The most important aspect to the **Cornucopias Metaverse**.  

</br>

The Cornucopias metaverse project is leading the **Crypto Gaming Revolution** - both users and the core development team are incentivized to work together to grow our network.  

</br>

Community members, also known as **Cornucopians**, continue to increase every day.  
The communityâ€™s consistent feedback and communication have been instrumental in helping develop a one-of-a-kind, blockchain-based game.  

</br>

Users with the most engagement earn **OG status** and are rewarded for their efforts.
