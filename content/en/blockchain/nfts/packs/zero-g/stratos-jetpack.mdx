# Zero G - Stratos Jetpack  

The Zero G - Stratos Jetpack launched on 1st November 2024.  

The Zero G Stratos Pack features four quantum compression chambers located at the base, designed to intake and compress air until oxygen liquefies.  

This liquid oxygen powers the mini turbo jet, creating the propellant needed for thrust. Air is drawn in through the top by four mini turbines, compressed as it moves through the central system, and ignited to produce combustion.  

Thrust is generated through the bottom exhaust, lifting the user off the ground. While the quantum compression and liquefaction process isn’t continuously sustainable, the device automatically recharges after each use.  

Perfect for exploration and short-term travel, the Zero G Stratos Pack allows users to effortlessly traverse challenging terrain or reach elevated areas, making mobility both efficient and exhilarating.
