# GTi - Rampage 2XS OG Custom Jetpack  

The GTi - Rampage 2XS Jetpack launched on 21st March 2025.  

The GTi Rampage 2XS OG Custom is a high-intensity dual-engine jetpack built for explosive thrust and rapid aerial maneuvers. Utilizing the same quantum compression technology found in top-tier propulsion systems, the GTi Rampage 2XS OG Custom features two powerful engines that generate short, aggressive bursts of lift, making it ideal for quick repositioning, evasive manoeuvres, and rapid ascents.  

At the heart of the GTi 2XS OG Custom are two quantum compression chambers that intake and compress air until oxygen liquefies, fuelling the twin mini turbojets. Air is drawn through dual intake turbines, compressed through the central system, and ignited to produce an intense yet short-duration thrust. Unlike sustained-flight models, this jetpack is engineered for burst mobility, allowing users to react instantly to changing environments. The system automatically recharges after each use, ensuring consistent performance in high-pressure situations.
