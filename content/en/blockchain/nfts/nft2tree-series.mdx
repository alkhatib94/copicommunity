# NFT - NFT2Tree Series  

The NFT2Tree, created in partnership with **Veritree** (a Cardano project providing Verified Global Restoration Projects and accelerating the adoption of nature-based climate solutions), is a unique and environmentally conscious way to bridge the gap between the metaverse and real-life.  

<div className="note-box">
  The NFT2Tree series is used to "stress test" the performance and new features of the Cornucopias minting platform. A major NFT always follows the NFT2Tree sales.
