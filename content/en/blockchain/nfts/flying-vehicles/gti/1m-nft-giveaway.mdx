# $1m NFT Giveaway  

## Minting Issues  

After nearly 3 hours of backend problems, the mint for the **GTi Javelin** was halted, only **5x GTi Javelins** were actually minted.  

They were immediately listed by their new owners on [jpg.store](https://www.jpg.store/collection/cornucopiasgtijavelin2022) marketplace showing the buyers were crypto speculators, not supporters of the project that wanted to keep hold of the NFT assets.  

However, the **Famous 5** will always be remembered, they are:  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li><span className="rarity-common">Javelin CM22 #00141 - Common Status</span></li>
  <li><span className="rarity-rare">Javelin RA22 #00190 - Rare Status</span></li>
  <li><span className="rarity-common">Javelin CM22 #00126 - Common Status</span></li>
  <li><span className="rarity-common">Javelin CM22 #00144 - Common Status</span></li>
  <li><span className="rarity-common">Javelin CM22 #00121 - Common Status</span></li>
</ul>

## $1m NFT Giveaway after the Mint was canceled  

After nearly 3 hours we decided to **cancel the mint** and give away the **GTi Javelin NFTs** for free to everyone that was in the mint queue.  

We also refunded the **Famous 5** to be fair to them as well.  

Here are some articles and social media updates we have released:

> *"The community is the heart and soul of a blockchain project. If you have ever spent any time in our Discord, you will see we have a thriving, happy, helpful set of supporters.*  
>   
> *But it's not good enough to just 'care' about your community; you also have to 'take care' of your community.*  
>   
> *We recognize our supporters are global, and during mint times, some people take time off work or get up early or stay glued to screens.*  
>   
> *If you truly want to understand your supporters, you must also recognize the sacrifices people go through to follow you.*  
>   
> *This is why it was a difficult call to stop our mint after a few hours. It was an easy decision to give away the precious NFTs we had painstakingly created for our game as compensation for our unforeseen technical difficulties.*  
>   
> *Strong decisions form strong communities, and we put our community's well-being ahead of sales."*
