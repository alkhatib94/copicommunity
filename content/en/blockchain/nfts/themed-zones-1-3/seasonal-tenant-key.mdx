# NFT - Seasonal Tenant Key 

<div className="note-box warning transparent">
  The Seasonal Tenant Key may be integrated into the gameplay and may not require an NFT as originally planned and explained below.
</div>

Each Themed Zone in Cornucopias will encompass district properties which have the ability to be rented by other players. When a player rents a property, they become the tenant of the property. The tenancy agreement with the property owner lasts for one season only, but a tenant will be able to renew their agreement before the next season starts.

</br>

To become a tenant a player must own a seasonal tenant key - this represents the tenancy agreement. The seasonal tenant key will be purchased in the form of an NFT and this will be used as proof of residency within Cornucopias.

</br>

After the season has completed the seasonal tenant key can be renewed (if the owner permits) within a limited timeframe to ensure the player can remain in their chosen property.

</br>

If the seasonal tenant key is not renewed within the given timeframe (and before the next season starts) then the NFT no longer plays a part in Cornucopias and will remain in your blockchain wallet as a souvenir of your time spent in Cornucopias.

</br>

Once you own a seasonal tenant key, you can become a resident of a district by staking your seasonal tenant key onto a district property.

</br>

Once a seasonal tenant key has been staked, it will remain staked for the rest of the season and cannot be changed to another property.
