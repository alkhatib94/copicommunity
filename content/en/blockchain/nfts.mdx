# Rarities Formatting  

The table below shares the rarity and distribution method.  

<div className="note-box info">
  <strong>Good to know:</strong> The current NFT design has a <b>Rarity Status</b> and a <b>Color Band</b> at the bottom, this is what is referred to in the chart below.
</div>  

- **<span className="rarity-common">Common</span>** [White / #FFFFFF] - Accounts for **45%** of all NFT batches.
- **<span className="rarity-uncommon">Uncommon</span>**  [Green / #99CC00] - Accounts for **27%** of all NFT batches.
- **<span className="rarity-rare">Rare</span>** [Blue / #00CCFF] - Accounts for **18%** of all NFT batches.
- **<span className="rarity-legendary">Legendary</span>** [Pink / #FF00FF] - Accounts for **9%** of all NFT batches.
- **<span className="rarity-mythic">Mythic</span>** [Orange / #DF9326] - Accounts for **1%** of all NFT batches.



<div className="note-box warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong> The color of the NFT asset can be anything; only the <b>Color Band</b> is being described here. See examples below.
</div>

# Fair Minting Distribution  

The maximum number of NFTs for each mint that has rarities is always divisible by 100 and the items are pre-ordered to ensure a fair distribution.  

Unless otherwise stated, the steps for ensuring rarity minting distribution work as follows:  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>A list of 100 NFT items is created in a batch using the rarity chart below. i.e. 45x Common, 27x Uncommon, 18x Rare, 9x Legendary and 1x Mythic.</li>
  <li>The list is then scrambled and added to a master list.</li>
  <li>Step 1 is repeated until the maximum number of NFTs have been added to the master list.</li>
</ul>  

The above process ensures that if the mint was stopped or paused part way through, the best effort would have been made to maintain the rarity distribution.  

</br>

### Minting Distribution and Testing Notes  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>Using the above process, it is highly unlikely that more than **10x Common NFTs** are minted in a row.</li>
  <li>It is possible to have 2x Mythic NFTs minted one after another, but this has never been reproduced during testing. Theoretically possible but extremely rare.</li>
  <li>It is impossible to have 3 Mythic NFTs minted in a row.</li>
</ul>
