# Cross Chain NFTs



There may be other NFTs that reside within your blockchain wallet. We provide a way for them to have potentially more utility.

</br>

Some NFTs can be displayed on your character, and others can be displayed on other items in-game. For example on a picture in your home bubble house or on the side of various objects (more details on this in the future).

</br>

For some projects, Cornucopias will go a lot further with interoperability. Some non-related Cornucopias NFTs will find first class citizenship within the metaverse game.

</br>

Through our partner network, we select quality projects and integrate them directly. Imagine racing a horse or car in Cornucopias using an NFT you had long forgotten about - did this game just get better and better?

  <b>Heads up:</b> Interoperability is added project-by-project. Details on supported collections and specific utilities will be announced in dedicated updates.
