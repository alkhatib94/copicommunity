# Managing Pool Server

From time to time, pool servers are going to need to be upgraded or restarted.  
The following are a few commands that can be used to hopefully get your pool back to earning rewards.

This kind of maintenance is using the command line, but don’t worry, it is not that hard.  
Similarly to the example in **Change to working folder:** `cd d:\CornPoolServer`, go to that same path.

If the pool server needs to be stopped, then the following command can be used.  
This function can also be achieved using the docker desktop. Find the container named **“pool-server-1”** and click the stop button.

<div>
  <pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap m-0">
    <code className="language-bash">
docker compose stop
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>

</br>

If the pool server needs to be restarted, click the stop and start buttons in docker desktop  
or execute this command in the same folder as the `docker-compose.yml` file.

<div>
  <pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap m-0">
    <code className="language-bash">
docker compose restart
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>

</br>

This is the maintenance that must be done on the command line.  
Docker desktop is improving, and it may provide deeper integration with docker compose in the future,  
but until then, these commands will help to recreate the pool server container.

<div>
  <pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap m-0">
    <code className="language-bash">
docker compose stop
docker compose rm
docker compose up -d
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>
