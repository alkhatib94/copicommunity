# Introduction  

## History  

The current version of the file nodes started in **April of 2024**.  

Before the current iteration, there was a prototype that was built and even thoroughly tested.  
This prototype provided the team with a proof of concept that was used to sell the concept to the community.  

<br />  

## Goals  

The following are the main goals of the project:  

<ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
  <li>
    Provide an opportunity for the community to participate in providing infrastructure for the Cornucopias game.  
    This has been done by the selling of NFT’s that represent a license to run a file node with their own resources.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide a more optimized way to download the game.  
    Generally, it should reduce the time from starting to download to playing the game.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reduce the cloud infrastructure costs.
  </li>
</ol>

# File Nodes  

Over the last couple of years, the Cornucopias community has had the opportunity to buy file node NFT’s.  
These file nodes represent the “license” to run a file node.  

By using one license, you are expected to do the work allotted to that node.  
The demands on a single node will change based on the number of nodes that are active in the file nodes network and the amount of download requests.  

<br />  

# Pool Servers and Delegation  

A file node owner also has the privilege of running a pool server.  
A pool server is the actual software that will get the work done.  

- At first, every file node owner will be required to run their own pool server.  
- As the program matures, file node owners will be able to allow others to run their node.  

The action of allocating a node to a specific pool server is called **delegation**.  
At first, file node owners will be required to delegate to their own pool servers that they run.  
Delegating to public pool servers is a feature that is currently high on our roadmap.  

A file node owner may want to run a pool server to support their one node.  
Delegating the node to a pool server will yield a proportional number of requests such that each node in the network gets the same amount of work.  

- If the file node owner delegates a second file node to their pool server, the amount of work will double.  
- If the owner delegates a third node, the requests would triple.  

The delegation of work is based on the active nodes in the network and **not** on the pool server.  

<br />  

# Rewards  

Soon, rewards will solely be based on the active participation and performance of the file node.  
Ensuring that a node is delegated to the best possible pool is important in order to maximize rewards.  

This is the responsibility of the owner, and it will require some attention.  

<div className="note-box green transparent">
  <b>Note:</b> There is a feature on the roadmap that will allow file node owners to automatically delegate their node to the best performing nodes.  
  Check back for details. Until then, check on your nodes regularly.
