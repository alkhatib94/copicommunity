## Introduction  

Pool operators have been able to delegate their own nodes to the pools they are operating since the beginning of the project. However, we are providing the ability for users that are not running pools to delegate their nodes to a public pool.  

</br>

## Expectations for Rewards  

Delegating a node to a pool is vital for rewards. We are changing the rewards up a little bit. It used to be that you had to register your node in the cornucopias account website. This is still valid, but users will no longer be able to manage their registered state. Instead, users will be able to delegate their nodes to a pool.  

</br>

## Pool Fee for Delegation  

The pool fee represents the percentage of performance rewards that a pool operator receives from delegations.  
For example, if a pool sets a 50% fee, it will retain 50% of the performance rewards earned by each new delegation.  

This fee is **fixed at the time of delegation**. Any future changes to the pool’s fee do not affect existing delegators.  

</br>

## How to Delegate  

### Choose a pool  

Check out the **[Public Pools Dashboard](https://cornucopias.io/nodes/pools)** for a list of available pools to delegate to.  

Pools can be configured to receive up to 50 delegations. If a pool is FULL, you cannot delegate to it.  

When looking for a pool to delegate to, consider:  
- **Availability**  
- **Reliability**  
- **Speed**

### Delegate Your Nodes  

Go to the **Manage Nodes** page in your account.  

<figure className="img-center my-6">

If a node is un-delegated, click the **delegate** button.  
On the delegation wizard page:

1. Highlight the node(s) you want to delegate.  
2. Select a pool. Pools are grouped into:  
   1. Favorite Pools - STARRED by you.  
   2. Public Pools - open for delegation.  
   3. Your Pools - pools you own.  
3. Accept the agreement showing the fee %.

Once complete, you’ll see the results on the Manage Node page.  

> Note: Delegating to your own pools will set the pool fee as **0%**.

## Notes for Pool Operators  

- Pool fee is locked for each delegation.  
- Operators cannot kick out delegators.  
- Switching a pool from public → private removes all delegations.  

</br>

## Notes for Node Owners  

- Delegation is protected - the fee % is locked.  
- Delegation ends only if you **un-delegate** or the pool is made private.
