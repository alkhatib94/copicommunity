## Public Pools Dashboard

The public pools dashboard can be found at this URL:  
 https://cornucopias.io/nodes/pools  

The dashboard is the focal point for **delegation**.  
- Today: it simply shows performance info.  
- Future: it will help you decide the best pool to delegate your file nodes.  

The landing page lists **public pool servers** open for delegations, sorted by **performance strength** by default.

</br>

## Configuring a Public Pool

Once a pool server has been created, configured, and validated, do the following to list it on the dashboard:

1. Edit the pool and change its type to **public**.  
2. Ensure at least **8 nodes** have been delegated to the pool.  

⚠️ If the pool doesn’t appear right away, wait 24-48 hours. A full reward cycle may be needed to generate performance data.

You can also **update the pool’s picture and description** to attract delegators.  
 Pictures must be appropriate for all ages (final approval by Cornucopias team).

## Understanding the Public Pools Dashboard

Here’s a breakdown of the columns you’ll see (this is where you can really flex your strategy :

- **Picture** - Represents the pool visually.  
- **Name** - Globally unique name (keep it concise).  
- **Ticker** - A 3-5 character shorthand for the pool (unique).  
- **Region** - Measured by network latency, not physical location. Possible values:  
  - North America  
  - Europe  
  - Asia Pacific  
  - South America  
- **15 Day** - Total bytes served over the last 15 days.  
- **Last Cycle** - Bytes served in the last reward cycle.  
- **Saturation** - Shows available delegation slots.  
  - 8 own nodes = 40 total delegations  
  - 9 own nodes = 45 total delegations  
  - 10 own nodes = 50 total delegations  
  - FULL = no slots left  
- **Active Cycles** - Consecutive active reward cycles (resets if server goes down for 24h).  
- **Age** - Pool age since creation.  
- **Strength** - Ranked performance (bars). Formula:  

Strength = (Byte Rate) * (Success Rate) * (Cycles with ≥1 registration %)


- **Byte Rate** = average bytes/sec (15 days).  
- **Success Rate** = % of successful requests (15 days).  
- **Cycles %** = % of cycles with ≥1 registration.  

> Strong pools = faster + more reliable = ranked at the top.

</br>

## Sorting

- Sort by **name**, **ticker**, or **strength**.  

</br>

## Filtering

- Filter by **region**, **availability**, or **strength**.  

</br>

## Public Pool Detail

When you click into a pool, you’ll see more detail:

### Description  
Pool owner’s mission, purpose, and reasons to delegate. Can include social links.

### Graphs  

- **Check-In Counts** - How often the pool checked in (availability).  
- **Request Success Rate** - % of successful downloads vs. fails.  
- **Delegations Count** - Number of delegations per day (15 days).  
- **Speed** - Average bytes/sec (foundation of pool strength).  

### Delegators  

A full list of nodes currently delegated to the pool.
