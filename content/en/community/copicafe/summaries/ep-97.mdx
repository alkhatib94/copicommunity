</br>  

[00:10:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QSuIr-zTpLc&t=600) Explanation of the **rewards system**. Node rewards are tied to ownership on the 31st of each month. Selling a node before that transfers rewards to the new owner. Multiple node pools per machine are being tested. A VPS service and public pools are being considered.  

</br>  

[00:15:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QSuIr-zTpLc&t=900) Preview of the **new build**, releasing second week of July. Features include **leaderboards for racing and holocaches**, competitive tournaments, bug fixes, and API communication. Infrastructure scaling and server deployment tests will follow.

</br>  

[00:25:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QSuIr-zTpLc&t=1500) Development of the **player deck and progression system**. Skill trees for fishing, mining, and farming allow gradual progression. Land and its assets remain NFTs even when sold. Focus on organic growth through tournaments leading to 2025.  

</br>  

[00:30:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QSuIr-zTpLc&t=1800) Explanation of **seasonal progression**: four 13-week cycles aligning with real-world seasons. Seasons affect fishing, crops, and challenges. At season’s end, top players earn NFT rewards (outfits, vehicles, tools). Competitions such as racing and fishing leagues are included.  

</br>  

[00:35:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QSuIr-zTpLc&t=2100) Integration of **Web3 technology** for asset ownership, rentals, and transfers. Tools are being built for seamless onboarding of casual and hardcore gamers. Plans for land ownership, education tools, and mobile/web versions.

She shares her journey from freelance VR chat avatars to Cornucopias, where she’s worked for two years on outfits and sets.

</br>  

[00:45:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QSuIr-zTpLc&t=2700) Natalia and the team discuss **outfits and hairstyles**: fishing, mining, racing outfits, and styles like faux hawks, ponytails, bull cuts, and bobs. Variations in curliness and texture add depth. Tools include **Unreal Engine 5** and **Blender**. Facial hair presets teased.  

</br>  

[00:50:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QSuIr-zTpLc&t=3000) Introduction of **material cards** for outfits. Players can change materials and textures for more customization. Additional hair types and accessories like glasses and hats are in development. Avatar creator iteration two expands customization with sliders and advanced functions.
