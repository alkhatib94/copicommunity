# Episode 112 - <span className="text-orange-500">Super Nodes</span>  

In Episode 112 of COPICafe the hosts Rob and Josh discuss the latest goings on in the land of *Cornucopias.*  

</br>  

Central to the discussion is the Juggernaut vehicle, highlighted for its impressive cargo capacity and five rarity levels, priced at $350, with a whitelist granting early access based on "corn points."  

</br>  

They also explore the ongoing development of nodes within the community, focusing on improved download speeds and regional structuring to enhance user experience and minimize latency.  

</br>  

The speakers emphasize community participation, especially through node operation and testing, while discussing affordable solutions like Raspberry Pi devices and the importance of custom art in game development to ensure a unique gaming experience.
