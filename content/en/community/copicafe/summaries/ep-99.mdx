# Episode 99 - <span className="text-orange-500">Next Stop... Solace</span>  

In COPICafe Episode 99 titled *"Next Stop... Solace"*, the hosts Josh Jones and Rob Greig discuss upcoming features in **Cornucopias**.  

</br>  

They cover the **File Node claiming process**, the upcoming **Solace release** and land grab event, optimizations in **racing and avatars**, and preparations for the **RareEvo conference**.  

</br>  

[00:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=0) The hosts update on **File Node rewards**. Only marketing and team nodes remain to be minted, with a total of ~9,000 nodes expected. Viewers are reminded to register their nodes before the deadline to qualify for rewards. Other topics include leaderboards and overall development progress.  

</br>  

[00:05:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=300) Reminder: **register nodes by July 31st, 2024 (UTC midnight)** via the "manage nodes" section on the website. Registration should be done early to allow for support. The **COPIC Stake Pool** is also highlighted, offering stakers a **25% $COPI bonus**.  

</br>  

[00:10:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=600) The team shares testing challenges. A hot fix grouped top performers, and the **inventory system** will soon move server-side. **Performance optimizations** were applied to racing by David and Kai.  

</br>  

[00:15:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=900) Updates on **racing optimizations** with multiple players. Praise for **Avatar 2.0** customization. Possible tweaks to racing physics are discussed to reduce luck. Tournament structures are being prepared. Excitement builds for the **Solace release** in the next build.  

</br>  

[00:20:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=1200) The devs reflect on progress since migrating to **Unreal Engine 5** two years ago. They highlight the **travel system**: players start in **Calido Valley**, take public transport to **Cloud Gate**, then choose Solace towns via 12 lifts. All travel is **seamless and free-roam**.  

</br>  

[00:25:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=1500) Excitement for the **Solace Zone release**, confirmed for **RareEvo (August 15-17, 2024)**. Solace enables faster travel systems, larger exploration areas, and more player variety.  

</br>  

[00:30:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=1800) Plans for the **land grab event**: players claim plots both in-game and via a webpage built from in-game screenshots. Available across PC, Mac, and mobile. The team is adding **crafting, fishing, competitions**, and preparing for talks with **Esports leagues**.  

</br>  

[00:35:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=2100) A new **community challenge**: find all **36 hidden town names** in a quiz. Viewers are encouraged to submit answers, with the promise of revealing them later. The team also invites players to **Caesarâ€™s Palace** for an upcoming conference.  

</br>  

[00:40:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=2400) Closing notes: anticipation for **RareEvo**. For those who cannot attend, the team invites them to join the next COPICafe episode and community racetracks.
