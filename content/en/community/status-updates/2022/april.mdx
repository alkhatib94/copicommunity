## Cornucopias Program Level Update  

### Summary  

The Cornucopias Program is on track and progressing well. The mobile game development team is operating in a fully agile environment and they have completed their fourth two-week sprint. The mobile team conducts all agile ceremonies including planning sessions, daily stand-ups and retrospectives.  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>In early April, the OG Sprinter NFT Mint went ahead and was an overwhelming success. The Cornucopias OG crew are very busy sharing and some are even selling on the second hand market for thousands of ADA!</li>
  <li>A Cornucopias Wiki has been developed that is a full guide to what we intend to build. This is a work in progress and will continue to change as the development process iterates. It will be published very soon and this is the next key milestone. The only task remaining is adding images to the version to be published.</li>
  <li>The next NFT sale is a land NFT sale as per our #roadmap and itâ€™s sometime this quarter but no confirmed date yet, but it will be announced well in advance.</li>
