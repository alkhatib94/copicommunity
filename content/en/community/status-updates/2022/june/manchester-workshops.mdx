# Manchester Workshops 2022  

In June 2022, **11 members** of Cornucopias (including all 4 founders) attended a **3-day team workshop** in Manchester, UK.  

The event was so successful that future in-person meet-ups are now being planned.  
It was a fantastic opportunity for team members to interact face-to-face and connect in a less formal environment.
