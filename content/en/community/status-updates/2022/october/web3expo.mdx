The <b>Cardano Foundation</b> hosted its own conference room where various Cardano project leads who had attended cNFTCon were invited as VIPs to speak at the event.

<p>
Cornucopias Co-CEO <b>Rob Greig</b> sat on a five-person panel discussing <b>Web3 sustainability</b>.

<p>
Although the event was primarily focused on the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities and headlined by <b>Kevin O'Leary</b> (Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank), the <b>Cardano community</b> showed up in numbers - and made an impact. Maybe next year weâ€™ll have an even larger presence?
