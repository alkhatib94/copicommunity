In October 2022 the **4x Founders** of Cornucopias attended the annual **RareBloom** event in Denver, Colorado - held at the **Gaylord Rockies Hotel**.  

This was a smaller event compared to **cNFTCon** earlier in the week, and Cornucopias did not have a booth.  
Instead, it was more of a **networking-focused event** with panels running across the 2-day schedule.  

## Highlights  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>The 4x Founders visited every booth (~50) and spoke to each project.</li>
  <li>Charles Hoskinson (CEO of IOG) attended alongside IOG &amp; Cardano Foundation members.</li>
  <li>Josh &amp; Rob recorded a Special Edition of <b>COPICafe</b> on a quiet floor above the conference. Hosted by Farid (dApp Central) &amp; Pritesh (Kaizen Crypto).</li>
</ul>

It was a great opportunity to connect with other project CEOs.  
A **Music Partnership with NEWM** was also announced - check out **COPICafe Ep. 27** for the announcement.
