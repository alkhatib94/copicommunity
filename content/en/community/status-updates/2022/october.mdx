# October 2022

## Summary

<div className="note-box success">
Delivery, public meet-ups, networking, Las Vegas​ + Denver public conference - cNFTcon & Web3Expo and RareBloom
</div>

October was an incredible month for Cornucopias, with **11 of the team** attending the first ever live annual **cNFTcon** event in Las Vegas and the **4 founders** attending the **Web3Expo (Las Vegas)** and **RareBloom (Denver, Colorado)**.  

Showing off **2 playable, multi-player demos** in Las Vegas was a "coming-of-age" for Cornucopias during the 12 days in America with the highlight being the CEO of IOG **Charles Hoskinson** playing the racing game demo - foreshadowing the launch of the first **eSports platform on Cardano** in early 2023.  

See October roadmap for more information on what we've been up to.  

At the start of October we achieved the **58m ₳ staked milestone** in the COPI StakePool from over 4600 delegates.

Finally on **31st October 2022** the Binance ↔ Cardano bridge (developed by ChainPort + Cornucopias) went live, allowing the $COPI token (and any other Cardano Native token) to be bridged between Cardano & Binance.
