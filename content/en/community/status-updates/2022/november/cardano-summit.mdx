# Cardano Summit 2022

**Lausanne - Switzerland - Saturday November 19th to 21st**

<p>
Each year the Cardano Foundation holds a community event to show off the blockchain, share milestones, and tease upcoming features. It was a 3-day event in Lausanne, Switzerland. There was also a <b>secret virtual garden</b> that remote attendees could visit to search and collect coins - when all coins were collected a commemorative Cardano Summit NFT was sent to their Cardano wallet.

<p>
For the first time, Cardano projects were invited to take the stage before a crowd of <b>~3,000</b> attendees. The event also ran across <b>50+</b> community-led hubs worldwide. Rob and Josh created a special video exclusively for the <b>Cardano Event in Brazil</b>.

## Community Awards

<p>
There were <b>16 categories</b> put to a community vote. After a public on-chain vote (signed with Cardano wallets), Cornucopias won both categories we were nominated for: <b>Metaverse</b> and <b>Gaming</b>. 🎉
</p>

<br />

## Panel - “Ready Every Player”

<p>
We were also invited to join the panel <b>“Ready Every Player”</b> about metaverses and the future of gaming.

<p>
Josh and Rob could not attend in person, so we prepared two speaker videos - <i>Cornucopias Game Reel - Nov 2022</i> and <i>Cornucopias Cardano Summit 2022 - Why Cardano?</i> - and joined the panel remotely via Zoom. Watch the recording below:

## Wrap-up

<p>
It was a great success for both Cornucopias and Cardano. We’re looking forward to next year’s summit - and funnily enough, we were told our videos landed an even bigger impact than some live talks thanks to their cinematic, highly visual style. See you next year!
