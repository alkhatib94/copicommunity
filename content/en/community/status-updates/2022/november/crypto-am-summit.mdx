# Crypto A.M. Summit and Awards 2022

**Leonardo Royal Hotel St Paul's - London**

<br />

## Crypto A.M.

Crypto A.M. is part of the London-based City A.M. newspaper which is London’s most-read financial and business newspaper, enjoyed by thousands of workers across the capital each weekday. Launched in 2006, it covers the latest economic, political and business news as well as comment, sport and lifestyle features.  

<br />

Crypto A.M. was devised and created by James Bowater, who is also one of the Cornucopias Advisors.

## City A.M.

<br />

Cityam.com has around 3.2 million unique visitors per month, primarily based in London and across the UK. They also have a strong international audience, with strong traffic sources from the United States and India.  

<br />

The City A.M. newspaper is distributed at more than 400 carefully chosen commuter hubs across London and the home counties, as well as London City Airport and over 500 offices throughout the City, Canary Wharf and other areas of high business concentration.  

<br />

Each year Crypto A.M. hosts a networking summit where projects from all blockchains are invited to talk on panels and discuss such categories as Web 2 to Web 3, Security, NFTs, Metaverse, Gaming, Crypto Law, and many more.  

<br />

It’s also an opportunity for large companies outside of crypto to come see what they are missing and ask questions and meet contacts.  

<br />

## Panels

The panels and talks took place in tandem across 2x rooms and Rob Greig spoke on Day 1 on the subject of *“How Blockchain is revolutionizing the Gaming sector”*.

## The 3rd Annual Crypto A.M. Awards

<br />

The awards were held at the Leonardo Royal Hotel in London St Paul's and a quick summary can be seen here.  

<br />

Cornucopias was chosen as one of the 3 finalists on the night to represent the *“Most Innovative NFT Project of 2022”* and unfortunately we were not chosen as the winner from the 12-person judging panel.  

<br />

It is important to remember at this point in time Cornucopias does not have a live game and was up against two long standing popular Ethereum projects - *SuperRare* (Winner and also last year’s winners) and *Niftyz*.

<br />

The Cardano Community were well represented, and it was noticeable that when Cornucopias was introduced as a finalist, all the other Cardano representatives cheered loudly - we are so proud to be part of an amazing supportive community.  

<br />

Some notable projects we managed to speak to: Cardano Foundation, Tingo Mobile, Clay Nation, World Mobile, Cudos, Dega, SuperRare, to name just a few.
