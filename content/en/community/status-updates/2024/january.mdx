# January 2024  

## SUMMARY  

In January our team was focused on completing our 90 Day Plan from Q4 of last year, as well as setting our 2024 business / development goals and another specific roadmap for the next 90 days. This year will see the release of several huge gameplay elements, which will comprise the core game loops of Cornucopias as originally envisioned.  

In the next 12 months we‚Äôll be building out systems surrounding XP & player progression, avatar creation & customization, player inventory / interaction, crafting, gathering and world travel. Once complete, these systems will form the basis of the core game loop. To that end, over the next 90 days we‚Äôll be working to release:  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>Expanded Game Lore</li>
  <li>Character Creator</li>
  <li>Character Inventory</li>
  <li>Art Passes for the completion of Solace</li>
  <li>Mining</li>
  <li>Vehicle Traveling</li>
</ul>  

Our goal will be to implement the systems needed for a Land Grab in Solace, which we‚Äôre looking to execute in the first half of the year. More on that soon!

## ART  

This month our Art team has been hard at work on the assets needed for delivery of the next build, scheduled for early Feb, but our primary focus has been the sector passes for Solace (as it will be for the next few months).  

As a part of the Art Team‚Äôs current sector work, David previewed a **Land Plot Scanner Device** on COPICafe #78.  

This will allow players to see info on Solace Land Plots, once they‚Äôre open to the public - which will be soon! Stand by for additional dev & timeline updates.
