# August 2023  

## SUMMARY  

The Cornucopias team is wrapping up a monumental August, which began with several updates related to the public testing of Calido Resort and ended with a tour de force trip to the Rare Evo conference in Denver.  

In between those two pushes, we’ve focused on bringing more structure to our internal processes and support for our individual workflows. Now that we are opening the gates to a publicly playable Cornucopias experience, we’re focused on ensuring that our infrastructure (both human and technical) is prepared to scale in a big way. Highlights include:  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>New rounds of public testing for Calido Resort, with added functionality &amp; upgrades for Calido mini-games.</li>
  <li>The reviews are in: early tester reactions to Calido Valley have been overwhelmingly positive! More info below.</li>
  <li>Delivered improvements to our game DevOps environment, with additional fleet management &amp; auto-versioning of game builds on the way (a huge quality of life improvement for testers and devs alike).</li>
  <li>
    Added a senior DevOps lead to design &amp; implement scalable architecture for our game &amp; web servers.
  </li>
  <li>Improved website functionality for the Launcher downloads.</li>
  <li>Introduction of <b>Mining</b> - a brand new mini-game for Calido.</li>
  <li>Final preparation for the public release of the Racing League, which we expect to debut at the NFTxLV conference in late September.</li>
</ul>  

This work sets us up for a huge month ahead, as we prepare to finally strap in to our Bubblejetts and challenge each other to some serious Calido Raceway competition. Stay tuned, as we’ll have a ton of info dropping in the weeks ahead.

## ART  

<ul className="styled-list">

    Our Art team has been primarily splitting focus between delivering the goods for Mining in advance of Rare Evo and putting the finishing touches on the vehicles and tracks for the Calido Raceway, which we plan to showcase at September’s NFTxLV conference.

## DEVELOPMENT  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>
    We made a splash at this year’s Rare Evo with the introduction of <b>Mining</b> for Calido Resort testers.  
    <br />  
    The Mining mini-game allows players to hunt down valuable minerals and resources that will be used for in-game equipment &amp; powerups. This is our first rollout of what will eventually become Cornucopias’ character leveling, inventory &amp; crafting systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    We’re also rolling out some environmental updates, including <b>“Calido Midnight”</b>, which gives players an entirely different experience of the Calido cityscape after dark:

<br />  

## WEB  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>Added a new DevOps lead to the team, whose role will be to improve our existing infrastructure for web delivery, as well as create new auto-versioning updates for our game builds.</li>
  <li>Updated player API to add PC specs to player profile data, allowing our bug triage team to parse error requests by submitter’s video card / CPU specs.</li>
  <li>Improved processing &amp; security measures around wallet integration.</li>
  <li>Updated Desktop Launcher → Game processes, to address unexpected restarts and force quits of the Launcher.</li>
</ul>  

<br />
