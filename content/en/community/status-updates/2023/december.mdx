# December 2023

## SUMMARY

2023 was a momentous year for us. This month we were deep in the trenches of the 90 day plan we rolled out in October, and we’re on track for some major releases in January and beyond - see Roadmap.

Now we’re looking forward to knocking it out of the park in 2024. The 90 Day Plan mentioned in our last update will expire on 18th January 2024, and the Cornucopias leadership is already laying the foundation for the next quarter. In the meantime, here’s a breakdown of the team’s December activity:

<br />

## BUSINESS

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>The $COPI token was listed on Gate.io beginning on <b>21st December 2023</b>.</li>
  <li>
    December saw the launch of our <b>COPI File Node</b> sale, which is just as much a win on the game/tech side as on the business side. The first set of COPI File Nodes allows both Cardano and Ethereum users to host chunks of our game and distribute it to other players when requested by the Launcher. This both decentralizes our game service and allows for COPI File Node owners to participate in the node rewards program. Details and FAQs can be found in the docs below:

    Our <a href="/en/community/copicafe">COPICafe</a> production slowed down in November, but went into overdrive last month with a total of 5 episodes released!

## WEB

<p>
  Our web team has mostly been focused in two directions: support for the new marketplaces and engineering a custom solution for game DevOps &amp; Infrastructure. This will be a huge undertaking for the team, but should provide for a seamless experience for any number of players within Cornucopias’ multiple zones.
</p>

<p>This month’s features include:</p>

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>Game build delivery &amp; stability improvements</li>
  <li>Delivery of Marketplace for COPI Nodes</li>
  <li>Improved Desktop Launcher stability</li>
</ul>

<br />

## COMMUNITY

<p>
  This month’s community engagement has centered around the COPI File Node which is our first cross-chain release on a yet to be announce Ethereum Layer 2 chain. Community events were a little slow in December due to the holidays, but we’ll be cranking the activity back up in the new year!
