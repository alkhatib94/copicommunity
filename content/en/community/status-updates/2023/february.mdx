# February 2023  

## HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY  

<div className="note-box info transparent">
  <p style={{margin: 0}}>
    <b>First Deliverable of 2023!</b>
  </p>
</div>  

On **10th February 2023** we launched our **new look website** and spoke about it in **COPICafe Episode 41**.  
The website is more than a re-skin - it has a new backend framework that will enable new functionality for future services.  

Similar to January, February started with another new team member - a very talented **animator** working on in-vehicle animations for the upcoming **Racing League**.  

At the start of February 2023, the **COPI StakePool** was reduced from **45m ‚Ç≥** to **39m ‚Ç≥** as we hit what may be the bottom of the bear market.  
The number of delegates remains strong at nearly **5,000 Cardano addresses**.  

<div className="note-box success">
  <p style={{margin: 0}}>
    We are always very grateful to everyone who supports us by delegating to the Cornucopias Cardano StakePool ticker: <b>COPI</b>
  </p>
</div>  

Josh and Rob were joined on **Episode 42 of COPICafe** by **Joshua Noriega**, the host of YouTube channel *Late Game Crypto*, who recently did an amazing review of Cornucopias.
