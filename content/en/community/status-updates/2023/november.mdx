# November 2023  

## SUMMARY  

In last month’s update, we talked about focusing on the delivery of our core game loop. In November, we’ve been running full-out towards that goal. Our teams, along with our senior management have developed a 90-day plan that includes:  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>Base Art completion for <b>Solace-1</b> and <b>Solace-2</b></li>
  <li>Inventory &amp; XP Systems</li>
  <li>Full suite of backend APIs to facilitate those systems ^^</li>
  <li>
    Updates for <b>Calido Valley</b>, including:
    <ul className="styled-list">
      <li>Detail Passes</li>
      <li>Cornucopias Labs</li>
      <li>GTI Store Opening</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Land Plot integration</li>
  <li>Sector architecture</li>
  <li>Emote System &amp; Animations</li>
  <li>Additional Avatars &amp; NPC’s</li>
  <li>Delivery of Avatar Creator</li>
  <li>Public Transport System</li>
  <li>Foliage Integration</li>
  <li>Mining Starter / POA pack</li>
  <li>NorthPoint Hills Release with Mining</li>
</ul>  

And more! This is currently a wishlist, so some of these items may skip the initial release, but as of today we’re on track for delivery by early 2024. Meanwhile, we’re continuing to deploy new fixes and features. Here are the highlights of our November output:  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>
    This month we published another <b>UE5 testing release</b> - Sunrise Social (Release 0.2.18) - featuring a persistent day / night cycle. Users can see the local time displayed in the top right corner of the UI, with a 4 hour real time cycle representing 24 hours of astral movement in Cornucopias.
  </li>
  <li>Updated cloud / weather system, making for improved sunrise and sunset events</li>
  <li><b>Emotes</b> - users can hold “directional pad down” on controllers or “B” on keyboards to enter the emote selection menu. Express yourself!</li>
  <li>Global chat with emoji support</li>
  <li><b>Night racing</b> - if you thought racing at ludicrous speed was a thrill, try it with headlights</li>
  <li>New Avatar / NPC - the dubious <b>Dusty</b>, infamously known as “Rattlesnake”</li>
  <li>Vehicle performance improvements</li>
  <li>Technical optimization - CPU, memory and GPU usage have been improved</li>
  <li>We announced the return of our <b>NFT staking program</b> - details below</li>
</ul>  

As usual, we’ll be dripping out exclusive new content over the coming weeks to give some hints &amp; previews to the next features we’ll be putting out. Stay tuned!

## BUSINESS  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>
    Early this month we announced the return of our <b>NFT staking program</b>. For this staking program, users will delegate their ADA and earn COPI based on their NFT holdings for that wallet. While users will receive ADA rewards for their delegated ADA, they will only receive COPI rewards for the qualified NFTs. More details can be found in the Land Staking Deck linked below (click for pdf download):

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>COPI / ETH liquidity</b> was announced on <b>Uniswap</b>, moving us further towards our goal of being a multichain gaming platform.
  </li>
</ul>

## MARKETING  

<ul className="styled-list">

  </li>
  <li>
    November saw the release of only one <b>COPICafe</b>, but it’s a doozy. Featuring leaks from Solace-2, updates on marketing &amp; testing, as well as heartfelt explorations of Josh &amp; Rob’s beverage choices, it’s a must-see:

  </li>
</ul>  

</br>  

## ART  

<p>
All the new releases in addition to continuing work on <b>Solace-1</b> and <b>Solace-2</b> have been keeping our Art department extremely busy, and the results speak for themselves.  
</p>  

<p>
We’ll be leaking out new graphics and news as progress on Solace-1, Solace-2 and the Racing League continues in December.  
</p>  

</br>  

## DEVELOPMENT  

<p>
The dev team made an excellent <b>“Pre-Alpha” video</b> showcasing our current progress. Check it out below. Spoilers galore!   
</p>  

  

</br>  

## WEB  

<p>
Following our 90 Day Plan, we’re still focused on building support for our upcoming Solace releases &amp; expanded testing groups. Highlights include:  
</p>  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>Automating game build delivery</li>
  <li>Prepping for GameLift integration</li>
  <li>Preparing internal marketplaces for upcoming crosschain sales</li>
  <li>Improved security for API endpoints &amp; game sessions</li>
</ul>  

<p>
Our Web and backend teams may not be putting out the same kind of showstopping, sexy screenshots that our Art department delivers, but their efforts are critical to our success. We want to make sure that everyone who wants to play Cornucopias has an excellent experience with our product, and our backend efforts are key to delivering it consistently and at scale. These guys and gals are the unsung heroes of our org and are working diligently to get the full functionality of this game in your hands ASAP.
