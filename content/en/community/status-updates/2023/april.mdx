# April 2023  

## SUMMARY  

March was an intense month of progress for the Cornucopias team, as we are hurtling towards the release of the **Racing Game**. This release will be a huge milestone for the brand - in addition to providing the first publicly playable intro to Cornucopias, it represents a microcosm of the full Metaverse.  

Players will get their first taste of Dome environments, Bubblejetts, Cornucopias NPCs and more. The amount of amazing design and development the team has poured into these projects has been incredible, and we can’t wait to share their work with you.

Happy spring from the entire Cornucopias team - see you on the racetrack soon!
