# May 2023  

## SUMMARY  

The Cornucopias team was once again running full tilt last month, with the delivery of our very first user-facing functionality. With the soft launch for public testing of our **Player Profile** and the upcoming **alpha** release of the **Metaverse Launcher**, we’re moving into a new phase of development and prepping for everyone to get their first live taste of the **Calido Valley Racing Mega Dome**.  

If you haven’t signed up to get your Player Profile, connect your wallet and get in line for the Cornucopias Racing League - stop what you’re doing and register! We can’t wait to see you all at the Raceway.  

While we’re busy at work with final tasks related to the Metaverse Launcher and Calido Valley Raceway, we’re also spinning up a few new initiatives in our Community and with strategic partners like **DEGA** - all paving the way for the release of our first playable content. Here’s a quick overview of our activities in May:
