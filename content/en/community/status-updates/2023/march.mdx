# March 2023  

## HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY  

<div className="note-box success">
  <p style={{margin: 0, color:"#22c55e"}}>
    A Cardano based Staking option and tons of development activity
  </p>
</div>  

In the final month of Q1 on **3rd March 2023**, we launched our first **Cardano-based Staking option** with our long term partners **VyFinance**.  

This offers staking now on Cardano and also on Binance with TokensFarm which we launched our 5th pool last month.  

Alongside this brief month update, we are constantly providing development updates on our **Discord Channel**, **Twitter**, and other mediums such as our **YouTube channel** within the **COPICafe** series.  

This month Matt created a more detailed update in the form of a graphical PDF. It really is something you need to see - a piece of art in itself.  

<div className="callout-code">

</div>  

<br />

The new improved editing of **COPICafe** continued with Episodes **44, 45, 46, 47 and 48**.  

This month, among our usual dev work, **Metaverse Game planning** continues. Notably the MVP planning for **Solace**: prototyping, tree chopping (Episode 48), and fishing. These may sound basic but they will be major gameplay mechanics.  

Our new animator has really hit his stride and continues to impress, as does the rest of the team.  

At the start of March 2023, the **COPI StakePool** had been slightly reduced to **35m ‚Ç≥**, but delegates remain strong at just under **5,000 Cardano addresses**.

    We are always very grateful to everyone who supports us by delegating to the Cornucopias Cardano StakePool ticker: <b>COPI</b>
