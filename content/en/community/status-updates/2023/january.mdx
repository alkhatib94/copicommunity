# January 2023

## HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY

<div className="note-box info transparent">
  <p style={{margin: 0}}>
    <b>Planning &amp; Building</b>
  </p>
</div>

<p>
January starts off strong with a new team member joining us and the focus shifts to the delivery of many products. We have multiple teams and it's very common for team members to shift from one product to another (e.g., artwork for the Mobile Game &harr; artwork for the Racing Game).
</p>

<p>
We had a Twitter meme contest early January which really engaged the community. It was great seeing all the funny memes -

<p>
At the start of January 2023 the <b>COPI StakePool</b> had reduced from <b>64m ₳</b> (ATH in Nov 2022) to <b>45m ₳</b>. Although total ADA is lower, delegates are at an all-time high (&approx; <b>5,000</b> addresses) - support keeps growing even amid bear market conditions.
</p>

<div className="note-box success">
  <p style={{margin: 0}}>
    We are always very grateful to everyone who supports us by delegating to the Cornucopias Cardano StakePool ticker: <b>COPI</b>.
