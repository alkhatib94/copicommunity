# July 2023  

## SUMMARY  

Cornucopias is preparing to finish the most monumental month in its history. As of this publication date, final preparations are being made to release the Calido Valley Resort to a limited number of testers, followed by access to the Calido Valley Raceway in short order. This represents our first ship of publicly playable features, and our team has done an excellent job of navigating the last minute challenges that inevitably arise at this stage of the game.
