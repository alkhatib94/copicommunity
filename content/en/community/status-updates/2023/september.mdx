# September 2023  

## SUMMARY  

To say that this has been a mad dash of a month would be an understatement. In September, Cornucopias’ focus boiled down to one word: <b>CONFERENCES</b>.  

We started the month in Denver with the blockbuster debut of the Mining mini-game at RareEvo, and we’re ending it in Las Vegas at the NFTxLV conference with the launch of our soon-to-be-public Racing League. In the meantime, we’ve continued work on the Calido Resort, Calido Raceway and Solace. Highlights include:  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>New testing releases for the Calido Resort including <b>Magic Hour</b> and <b>Mythic Sunshine</b>, showcasing new atmospheric conditions, character improvements, Security Bot upgrades, new Mythic holo caches and more!</li>
  <li>Continued scaling for Calido Valley testing groups, as we work our way through various hardware profiles &amp; NFT subsets.</li>
  <li>Final touches on the Calido Raceway as we worked to roll out multiplayer Racing over multiple gaming stations at our NVTxLV conference booth.</li>
  <li>Improvements to our DevOps / game server systems, with progress towards our goal of auto-versioning for future game builds.</li>
  <li>Completed final detail &amp; performance issues for all Calido Valley racing vehicles.</li>
  <li>Completed improvements and fixes for all character models available for Calido Raceway.</li>
  <li>4 new playable characters added.</li>
  <li>Completed Racing Maps, including performance &amp; collision issues for the test tracks.</li>
  <li>Collected, collated and began work on a large &amp; growing list of user-reported bugs and suggestions for Calido Valley.</li>
  <li>
    The Launcher had a <b>HUGE update</b> with the ability to allow access to gameplay based on Graphics Card and NFT rarity/ownership - this will allow us to grow the testing groups by helping us to estimate the number of new testers that can be onboarded.
  </li>
</ul>  

Now that we’ve executed the herculean task of public Raceway testing, in October we’ll be moving our primary focus back to Solace, with the goal of getting players onto their land plots and beginning their true Cornucopias journey early next year. Until then, stick with us for more content & updates!

## BUSINESS  

<ul className="styled-list">

    <b>RareEvo</b> and <b>NFTxLV</b> were both smashing successes for Cornucopias! On-site users were able to get a first peek at the Calido Raceway and participate in multiplayer matchups at gaming stations in our booth. Click the link below for Scruffy’s coverage of the event:

  </li>
  <li>
    We’ve been building up to the NFTxLV conference in Las Vegas all year, so this month was a madhouse. We currently have several exciting irons in the fire on the NFT / Web3 side of the house, but aren’t yet ready to make public announcements on that front - so stay tuned in the coming weeks.

## MARKETING  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>
    In September our <b>COPICafe</b> output was somewhat light, with our founders and team members focused on conference deliverables. However we did publish episodes 65 - 67, which you can check out below:<br />

  </li>
</ul>  

<p>
Highlights for this month included discussions of dev updates, exclusive coverage of our conference appearances, interviews with our designers, lore drops and Mythic Sunshine previews.
</p>  

<br />  

## ART  

<p>
Most of our Art team’s bandwidth has been focused on behind-the-scenes work, polishing up the elements we’re showcasing in Vegas - but their work did include a few new vehicle mods and character avatars.
</p>  

<p>
We’ll be premiering more imagery &amp; functionality previews for Solace in the weeks ahead, as well as publishing some gameplay &amp; live shots from NFTxLV in the coming weeks - stay tuned!
</p>  

<br />  

## DEVELOPMENT  

<p>
Our Dev and Art teams worked hand in hand to deliver Mining and Racing experiences in time for NFTxLV, with stunning results:
</p>  

<p>
Between tasks for the Mythic Sunshine release, work on Solace and all the bells &amp; whistles necessary for an immersive racing experience the dev team has had its work cut out for it this month. We’ve made significant progress towards a foundation for the inventory system, which will be critical for future iterations of the game. In the coming weeks, we’ll be fleshing out more of that functionality as our focus turns more towards Solace for upcoming releases.
</p>  

<br />  

## WEB  

<p>
Our web team was also hard at work supporting the conference releases, though our work here was more focused on longer-term plans like security, player profile accessibility and server infrastructure. In September we:
</p>  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>Added a new senior Full Stack Web3 developer to the team, with the goal of helping us streamline future NFT sales and game integrations.</li>
  <li>Continued to spin up our new senior DevOps resource to help scale our infrastructure. As we continue to pull in more testers and transition to a limited public release, we want to make sure we stay ahead of the curve with seamless delivery &amp; fighting lag as our local traffic increases.</li>
  <li>Continued to roll out security features for player profiles &amp; game access.</li>
  <li>Released new specs for auto-assignment of testing roles based on user hardware.</li>
  <li>Improvements for existing build servers.</li>
</ul>  

<br />  

## COMMUNITY  

<p>
Eighteen members of our team were living large this month in Denver and Las Vegas, enjoying the opportunity to meet with our community face to face, with smile-inducing results.
</p>  

<p>
We’ll be dripping out additional content from these showcases in the coming weeks as we make our way towards the public release of the Racing Game.

## AOB  

<p>
For now through the end of the year we’ll be heads-down, working on a playable release of Solace. Many of the elements required for that release were already a part of the functionality that debuted at NFTxLV, so we’re well on our way to opening up the next exciting chapter of Cornucopias!
