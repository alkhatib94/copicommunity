## Updates to the NFT Minting Technology  

The **Valley Racework T3 mint** introduced an update to our minting platform that benefits the **Active and Long Term Supporters** of Cornucopias.  

</br>  

Over the previous months leading up to the mint, members in Discord collected FREE Virtual Daily Corn Points.

    <strong>Collecting Daily Corn Points is FREE and easy!</strong>  
    Simply go to the <b>Cornucopias Discord</b> and find the <code>daily-corn-claim</code> channel.  
    From here type <code>/daily</code> everyday to receive a random amount of Corn Points.

For the **T3 mint**, Discord members were able to spend **2,750 Corn Points** on buying a **Tier 1 access** to the T3 mint or **750 Corn Points** to buy **Tier 3 access**.

## 24 Hour Minting Window  

The **24 Hour - Tier 1 minting window** guaranteed a minting place for all who bought the Whale Pass, and it ensured people from around the world could mint their NFT at a time that suited them. (Some still stayed up until 2am just for the experience - haha, crazy!!)
