</br>

Discord is an instant messaging and digital distribution platform. Users communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called "servers".

</br>

Discord has played an important part in the history of Cornucopias and has been utilized as a Community tool from its inception. The Cornucopias Discord server is FREE to join and there are many channels for members to discover and chat in. The Cornucopias Community are very hospitable and like to maintain a Family Friendly environment.

</br>

Occasionally there are official Voice AMA (Ask-Me-Anything) events where the creators of Cornucopias are available to answer community questions.

</br>

By being a member of the Cornucopias Discord, users will be able to see announcements before they are shared on Social Media. In addition, our backend NFT marketplace uses Discord roles for managing whitelists and website access.

<h2 className="heading-orange">Discord Roles</h2>

<p>
  Discord Roles refers to a set of permissions with a name. There are a number of Roles available for members,
  and it is common for members to have multiple roles:
</p>

</br>

<h3 className="role-title green">Cornucopians</h3>
<p>All new users to Discord are Cornucopians and receive this role.</p>

</br>

<h3 className="role-title dark">OG | Old Guard</h3>
<p>
  Discord OGs are members that arrived here before October 13, 2021. They are the original members that have been with
  Cornucopias since the beginning.
</p>

</br>

<div className="note-box success transparent">
  The OG role is still open to all to obtain, to find out more visit Discord and go to the
  <a href="https://discord.com/channels/829374949587419137/921935691192078366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    &nbsp;#how-to-become-og
  </a> thread.
</div>

</br>

<p>
  The OG role is awarded to members of the community that have shown their support through helping others, being respectful and kind,
  and having genuine conversations in chat with fellow community members.
</p>

</br>

<p>
  The OGs will grow in proportion to the overall community, so it is considered "open". OGs are the first responders when we are
  looking to test anything internally or need support on heavy traffic days.
</p>

</br>

<p>This role is given to the main Discord administrators. These are Cornucopias employees.</p>
