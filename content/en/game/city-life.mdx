# City - Life

The **City** is a vast settlement for houses, shops, stadiums, and all kinds of recreational and entertainment.  
It is set in an immense **floating dome**, split into **sectors**.  

</br>

Each sector will have its own unique theme with huge landscapes filled with skyscrapers, stadiums, and parks for players to engage.  
Player-owned properties will come in the form of **NFT land** and will be used for **commerce** or **residential** needs.  

</br>

There is a great opportunity for businesses to set up a commercial footprint in **Cornucopias**.

## Commerce

The City will be a hub of activity with options to establish shops for players to engage in **peer-to-peer commerce**.  
These shops will be owned by real-world businesses and linked to **real-world commodities**.  

</br>

This means the City is the **bridge between Cornucopias and the real-world**.  

</br>

## Travel

There are many forms of traveling in the City:  
**walking, running, riding on mounts, city public transport, taxis, and player-owned vehicles.**

</br>

Players will be able to get around the **City Districts** via public transportation such as:  
**buses, taxis, bikes, and subway.**
