## Travel

The purest way to travel on land is by foot. Running from end to end in each Sector may take over 30 minutes.

To speed up travels, there are many player-owned mounts that are available to use or rent. Mounts will vary with performance specifications including; speed, acceleration, handling and load capacity.

There is an underground transport system that will allow players to travel quickly from town to town.
