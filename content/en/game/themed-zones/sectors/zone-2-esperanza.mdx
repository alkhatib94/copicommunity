# Zone 2 - Esperanza

'Wild West' was the early working title for this zone.

## Overview

Think back to the Wild West of America. The landscape encompasses a diverse biome, from hot and dry desert plains, rugged mesas, and sagebrush to immense valleys with great forests and cascading rivers.

To speed up travels, there are many player-owned mounts that are available to use or rent. Mounts will vary with performance specifications including; speed, acceleration, handling and load capacity.

There is an underground transport system that will allow players to travel quickly from town to town.
