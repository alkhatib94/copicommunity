# Land Sector - Districts

The place where your daily tasks begin ..

Each Themed Zone Land Sector is subdivided into multiple districts which encompass player and non-player owned; houses, merchants, workshops, farms, and other utility buildings. Each district is a community where players can socialize, quest, craft equipment and trade.

## Player Land Ownership

Player ownership of land plots is achieved through the acquisition of NFT Land.

## District Membership

Players are free to enter and wander around all the districts in the themed zones.  
Players just visiting one of the zones will be **capped on their Play-and-Earn potential**.  

Becoming a member of the district community opens the door to enhanced Play-and-Earn rewards.  
To become a member of the district, a player can either:  

<ul class="styled-list">
  <li><strong>Buy</strong> a district property.</li>
  <li><strong>Rent</strong> a bedroom in a district property owned by another player.</li>
</ul>

## The District Community

The District gives the player a sense of community, and the player gives back to the District with their loyalty in the form of completing tasks.  

This progress will be quantified into an overall **district score**.  
Working together with other members of the district will result in success and rewards for the district.  

The district score is tracked on the **District Leaderboards**.  
Each season the districts automatically compete against other districts and rewards are distributed to land owners and residents depending on how well the district performs. 

## District Economy

There will be various ways to earn income in a district, primarily coming from **trade** or **services** related to resources and crafting.
