# District - Town Hall

The central hub for every District.  
Information about the district status and ethos can be found here.  
For example: **village population** and **village economics**.

<br />

Surrounding the Town Hall, infrastructure is built to create an **NPC marketplace**.  
This includes a variety of **merchants** and **workshops**.

<div className="note-box">
  Players pay a fee to use merchants and workshops.  
  This fee will be lower at player-owned industrial and commercial properties.
