# Land Plot - Property Rentals

All the district residential properties are plots of NFT Land owned by players. These land plots come in set locations and have variations of size in order to form a curated layout within a district.

District land plots are sold individually to players, giving them ownership of the land. The owner of the land plot can choose to build a residential property in the form of a house.

The level of the district house determines how many residents that property can house and can be upgraded to increase the number of tenants. Other players now have the choice to rent the property. This is done on a season-per-season basis and is managed with the use of a **Seasonal Tenant Key NFT**.

  <strong>Note:</strong> Upgrading a farmhouse provides the land owner with additional rooms to rent (potential revenue) and gives the tenant a temporary place to spawn. It also unlocks additional play options for the tenant as they will be now classed as a district member.

A room in the Farmhouse can be rented to other players, and Farmhouses can be upgraded from Small (or any other size) to Medium, Large, Epic, or Copias if there is available space on the land plot.
