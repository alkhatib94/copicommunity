# Property Rentals - Hotels

## Hotels can be NFTs or in-game assets

Hotels can be **NFTs** or **in-game assets**.

Hotels come in different types and sizes as follows and can be crafted/placed onto a player-owned NFT land plot:

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>Small (smallest)</li>
  <li>Medium</li>
  <li>Large</li>
  <li>Epic</li>
  <li>Copias (largest)</li>
</ul>

<div className="note-box success transparent">
  A hotel is an NFT building that can be added to player-owned land plots and provides the land owner with additional rooms to rent (potential revenue). It also gives the renter a temporary place to spawn and unlocks additional play options within the local district.
</div>

## Rental Benefits

If a player rents a room in a Hotel they have the following benefits:

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>The player can rest in the hotel and gain health and stamina benefits.</li>
  <li>The player can participate in district challenges.</li>
  <li>The player may receive discounts from the land owner&apos;s shops/utilities.</li>
</ul>

## Maintenance

Hotels require maintenance and repairs over time.  
The rate may be dependent on the size and the number of days the Hotel has been active.  
See **Building Maintenance** for more details.
