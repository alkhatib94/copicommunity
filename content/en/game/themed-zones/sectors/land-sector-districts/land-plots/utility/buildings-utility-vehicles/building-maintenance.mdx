# Building Maintenance

Buildings can be **NFTs** or **in-game assets**.

Some buildings require maintenance and repairs over time.  
To repair a building the player needs to gather raw materials and *construct* the repair onto the building.

The rate at which the building needs repairing is calculated partially based on random factors, and also dependent on the size of the building and the number of days it has been active.



## Maintenance Schedule

Each building may be up for maintenance at least once a season.  
If any repairs needed are not done over time the building may become unusable and may even **explode into raw materials**.
