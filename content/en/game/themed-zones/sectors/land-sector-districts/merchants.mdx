# District - Merchants

District merchants are buyers or sellers of commodities in the Themed Zones.  
Players throughout the metaverse can visit merchants when in need of resources.  

Each merchant will be subcategorized into specific commodities including: **crops, wood, metal, and plants**.

<br />

Every district will have merchants located in proximity to the Town Hall, owned and managed by NPCs.
