<div class="note-box danger">
  <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> The following information is still under development and may be changed, updated or removed before the game launches.

## District Land Maps

Every Sector is subdivided into multiple Districts. Districts encompass Player-Owned and Non-Player buildings such as; houses, merchants, workshops, farms, and other utility buildings. 

<div class="note-box">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Utility NFTs are unique digital assets that provide in-game practical application
</div>

Each District will have its own community, made up of the Players who populate the Land. Player communities will vary; some with thriving inter-player economies and vibrant community spirit! Others may be lacking prosperity, but this is just another opportunity for a new entrepreneur to capitalize on the Land and Resources available in all Cornucopias Districts.

<div class="note-box warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong> 4x Districts are planned per Sector however this may change before the game is released.
</div>

Buildings can be placed on NFT Land Plots. Most buildings will have in-game utility, this means they provide in-game practical facilities and tools for the land owner and other players to use.

Each Themed Zone contain multiple Sectors, each with unique features from diverse landscapes to exclusive Resources. These are simply miniature worlds for players to explore, socialize, quest, craft and trade.

Within Sectors, Players are able to gather a breadth of Raw Resources. To do so, Players are required to engage in various activities:

<ul class="styled-list">
  <li>Farming</li>
  <li>Mining</li>
  <li>Fishing</li>
  <li>Foraging</li>
  <li>Forestry</li>
</ul>

These Raw Resources can then be used for Crafting. This is the process of combining resources to create an item with more value than its intrinsic parts.



## District Land Plots

### Quantities

Each District will contain the following:

<ul class="styled-list">
  <li>Small Land Plots</li>
  <li>Medium Land Plots</li>
  <li>Large Land Plots</li>
  <li>Epic Land Plots</li>
  <li>Copias Land Plots</li>
</ul>

For the first 3 released Themed Zones; **Solace, Esperanza and Fortune** there are **24,000 land plots** made up of the following quantities and rarities:

<ul class="styled-list">
  <li>10,800 × Small Land Plots</li>
  <li>6,480 × Medium Land Plots</li>
  <li>4,320 × Large Land Plots</li>
  <li>2,160 × Epic Land Plots</li>
  <li>240 × Copias Land Plots</li>
</ul>



## Rarities

Each of the Player-Owned NFT Land Plots has a rarity assigned to it. Each rarity has benefits for the land owner and may have benefits to the players that enter/work on that land plot.

<ul class="styled-list">
  <li>12,000 × Common Land Plots (50%)</li>
  <li>6,000 × Uncommon Land Plots (25%)</li>
  <li>3,600 × Rare Land Plots (15%)</li>
  <li>1,800 × Legendary Land Plots (7.5%)</li>
  <li>600 × Mythic Land Plots (2.5%)</li>
</ul>

</div>

The land plots are NFTs and are owned by players. The land plot rarity may also have an impact on some elements of the land, for example the rarity determines what raw materials are found on the land at the start the season.

<div class="note-box success">
  <strong>Future Update:</strong> In the future NFT Land Plot Holders will be asked to choose a location for their land plot from a map. This event will be known as a "land grab" and will allow all land plot NFT holders to choose a land plot from a number of Sectors and Districts.  

  The "land grab" will use an algorithm based on the rarity of the chooser's NFT and will be explained in the future the aim is to be as fair as possible as many plots will have more than one person wanting to own them.
</div>

It is possible a District could be comprised of Mythic only land plots or Common only land plots, or a mixture of all 5 rarities. The land rarity arrangement is decentralized and is hard to predict.
