# District - Season Evolution

</br>

Districts will evolve from a basic level each season.  

</br>

Districts will evolve and develop based upon the success of the population of that specific district.  

</br>

To join a district, a player must own an **NFT Land** or become a tenant of a property by owning a **Seasonal Tenant Key NFT**.  

</br>

Players will be issued **Daily Challenges**, each with various levels of difficulty.  
Upon successful completion of these challenges, the player will receive a reward and score, which contributes towards the district score.  
The aim is to attain the highest score possible.  

</br>

As the season progresses the district will unlock various new items that can be placed in the district to make it more appealing.  
As the district *Levels Up* there will be new rewards for the district population.
