# District - Workshops

District workshops are buildings in the Themed Zones, where items are crafted or repaired.  
Players throughout the metaverse can visit workshops when seeking a station to combine resources to craft items that have greater value than their parts.  

Each workshop will be subcategorized into specific craftable items including:  
**blacksmiths, carpenters, kitchens, tailors, brickworks, and tanneries.**

<br />

Every district will have **NPC workshops** located in proximity to the Town Hall.
