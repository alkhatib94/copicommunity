# Zone 3 - Fortune

'Eastern Zone' was the early working title for this zone.

## Overview

Remindful of the Eastern National Parks. The landscape encompasses daunting volcanoes and limestone mountain passes. Temperate lowland rain forests to highland cloud forests, all connected through nature trails that wind through caves, lakes and waterfalls of sheer beauty.

## Travel

The purest way to travel on land is by foot. Running from end to end in each Sector may take over 30 minutes.  

To speed up travels, there are many player-owned mounts that are available to use or rent.  
Mounts will vary with performance specifications including; speed, acceleration, handling and load capacity.  

There is also an underground transport system that will allow players to travel quickly from town to town.
