Transport refers to the ways the player commutes across the Cornucopias Metaverse.  
There are different types of transportation available which depends on where the player is traveling.

## By Foot

The purest form of transport for players traveling across land.  
Certain controls can be used to toggle between **walking, running, and sprinting**.  
Respectively, these three modes of foot travel span from slowest to fastest.
