# Resources 

Crafting materials stored in the inventory  

Resources describe the crafting elements in the Cornucopias metaverse.  
These resources are gathered from the **Themed Zones** and stored in raw form,  
but must be processed in workshops in order to be used for crafting.  

The resource economy will be essential to the **Build-to-Earn** element of Cornucopias.  
Players will establish an in-game supply chain to distribute resources across the metaverse and meet the growing demand.
