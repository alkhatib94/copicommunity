# Custom Domes

_Player-owned Domes that can be customized_

Custom Domes are the largest form of NFT Land in Cornucopias, and serve as venues for games and events. Using an advanced building system, they can be molded into virtually anything.

  <strong>Note:</strong> Custom Domes will not be playable when the first version of the game is released.

Holders can construct freely within their Dome using our innovative and user-friendly Cornucopias Building System. This gives players the power to shape terrain, design and build structures, and showcase creativity -construction potential is truly limitless.

  As well as being standalone, the Custom Domes can be used to extend commercial buildings and experiences in the City.
  Moreover, Custom Domes can be linked to Cardano World.

Players will have access to both Themed Building Kits and Gameplay Kits. Themed Kits will help guide a desired experience (PVP, Concert Venue, Art Gallery), and Building Kits will give access to architectural and environmental assets to help create a setting.

Custom Domes can be used by a single player or multiple, including options to size your event and sell tickets and merchandise.

  Originally planned as rectangular, the Custom Domes were changed to be circular after extensive UE5 testing showed this
  was the most aesthetically pleasing shape, most flexible to build upon, and best for performance.
