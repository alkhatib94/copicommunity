# Custom Dome Template - Nightclub Experience
<br />
A player-owned custom dome will have the option to be turned into a nightclub. Custom domes have the capacity to allow for many simultaneous players, through the use of Size Your Event technology. 
<br />
With the use of a Green Screen or a Custom Avatar with Motion Capture, the DJ could virtually come alive on stage. A live stream or recorded set could be projected at the same time on multiple 200ft screens.

<br />
Various themes for your club are made available through the Community Built Asset Marketplace. This could include a futuristic neon nightclub in front of 1000 people, or a cozy underground scene in an invite-only VIP set.
<br />

In addition, there are options to sell tickets and/or merchandise for an event and even Rent out your Space.
