# Custom Dome Template - Theatre/Stage - Live Audience Experience

A player-owned custom dome will have the option to be turned into a theater or stage. Custom domes have the capacity to allow for many simultaneous players, through the use of Size Your Event technology. 

With the use of a Green Screen or a Custom Avatar with Motion Capture, the artist could virtually come alive on stage. A live stream or recorded set could be projected at the same time on multiple 200ft screens.

The entire stage can be customized by yourself or by utilizing the Community Built Asset Marketplace. This space can be curated to suit a theater or a stage for stand-up comedians, bands, or solo artists.

In addition, there are options to sell tickets and/or merchandise for an event and even Rent out your Space.
