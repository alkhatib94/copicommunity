# Custom Dome Template - Project/Company HQ

A player-owned custom dome will have the option to be turned into a Project/Company HQ. Custom domes have the capacity to allow for many simultaneous players, through the use of Size Your Event technology.​

The entire location can be customized by yourself or by utilizing the Community Built Asset Marketplace. This space can be curated to represent your brand or company and create that identifiable space that is instantly recognisable as your own.​
