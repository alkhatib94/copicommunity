# Custom Dome Template - Business Meetings

Template for a Player-owned Custom Dome that can be customized.

So many businesses work remotely now and they are all turning to popular 2D video sharing sites. But in the Cornucopias metaverse, we can do so much better.  

Create a **unique branded space** where your employees can hang out and meet together. Have multiple break-out rooms and/or a huge space for your daily gatherings.  

Take to the stage and give a unique monthly keynote with the use of a **Green Screen** or a **Custom Avatar with Motion Capture**. No longer will you have to be frustrated due to lack of meeting rooms.  

Show interactive presentations on **200ft screens**, share media and files in a safe, secure, locked-down space.  

Custom domes have the **capacity to allow for many simultaneous players/attendees** -see *Size Your Event* to find out more.  

There will also be an option for you to **sell tickets and/or merchandise** for your event and even rent out your space.  

A player-owned custom dome will have the option to be turned into a **business meeting room**, complete with interactive presentations and media files. The entire location can be customized by yourself or by utilizing the **Community Built Asset Marketplace**.  

Virtual expos are growing in popularity due to the lower cost of entry and the almost limitless possibilities to customize the event. Users can have separate spaces for keynotes or private VIP zones.  

With the use of a **Green Screen** or a **Custom Avatar with Motion Capture**, the key speaker could virtually come alive on stage. A live stream or recorded set could be projected at the same time on multiple 200ft screens.
