A **Play-and-Earn (P+E) API** will enable players to earn rewards for playing, as well as charge a fee for participation and set the winning pay-outs.  

Custom domes have the **capacity to allow for many simultaneous players** -see *Size Your Event* to learn more.  
And donâ€™t forget about the opportunity to **sell tickets and merchandise**!  

Furthermore, in the future there will be the opportunity to **use your own token as rewards**.
