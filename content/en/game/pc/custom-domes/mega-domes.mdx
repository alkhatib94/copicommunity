# Mega Domes

Mega Domes are a lot larger than Custom Domes, some are smaller than Sectors some are bigger.  

The Mega Domes are extremely large floating domes, which serve as venues for eSports and other very large events.  

The design of the Mega Dome environment will be built in-house to begin with followed in the future by a "no-code" system that uses a combination of templates and land building tools.
