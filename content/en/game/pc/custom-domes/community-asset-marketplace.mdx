# Custom Dome - Community Built Asset Marketplace

Community Marketplace to create assets for the Player owned Domes templates

There are opportunities within the Cornucopias metaverse for content creators to build compatible assets that they can sell to custom dome owners to use.

You could create:
<ul class="styled-list">
  <li>Nightclub venues - interior and exterior</li>
  <li>Theater/Stage/Bars venues - interior and exterior</li>
  <li>Game assets - e.g. interior furniture/props</li>

</ul>


All assets will be sold as an NFT and ownership will be transferred to the player that purchases the NFT.

We will provide a decentralized marketplace and release more information about this in the future.
