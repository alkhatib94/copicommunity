# Custom Dome - Size your Event

Deciding how many players can use your space at one time

The more players that are required to be in a **Custom Dome** at the same time, the more the backend has to scale with the use of synchronized servers. Unfortunately, scaling does come with a cost, but there will be a cheaper tier available for less demanding spaces.  

<ul class="styled-list">
  <li><strong>Tier F</strong> - designed for up to 10 players/guests</li>
  <li><strong>Tier E</strong> - up to 25 players/guests</li>
  <li><strong>Tier D</strong> - up to 50 players/guests</li>
  <li><strong>Tier C</strong> - up to 100 players/guests</li>
  <li><strong>Tier B</strong> - up to 500 players/guests</li>
  <li><strong>Tier A</strong> - supports 1000+ players/guests over multiple nodes</li>
</ul>
