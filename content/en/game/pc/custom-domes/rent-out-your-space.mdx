# Custom Dome - Rent out your Space

Your Space to do with what you will

The **Custom Dome** is an NFT, and therefore if you own the custom dome it is entirely up to you how you want to use it.  

We will provide the tools, user interface, and marketplace for you to **rent out your custom domes** to other players:

<ul class="styled-list">
  <li>Short term - 1 day, 1 week, 1 month</li>
  <li>Medium term - up to 3 or 6 months</li>
  <li>Long term - annual contracts</li>
</ul>  

From an **end-user** point of view, once you have agreed on a rental period, we will take care of the technical linking of the NFT to your account to ensure your space doesn’t disappear.  

From an **owner’s** point of view, we will ensure you are paid your rent on time.  

There are a **limited number of Custom Domes available**, so this could be your chance to own a special piece of the Cornucopias metaverse.
