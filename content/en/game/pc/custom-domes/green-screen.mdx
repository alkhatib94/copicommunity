# Custom Dome - Green Screen

Cornucopias is built on the Unreal Engine, which is an extremely powerful games and media platform. Cornucopias intends to use as many of the advanced tools available to us as possible. With the use of a green screen we can blend live action with computer graphics wherever you are -at home, in the studio, in a field anywhere practical.

If you host a YouTube channel and are used to green screens, you will feel right at home broadcasting in Cornucopias. If you have never used one before, it is a very cheap way to take your channel to the next level.  

The performance doesn't have to be live either; you can pre-record, edit and then upload your green screen content.  

Depending on the size of your space and green screen, you can show anything from a head shot to an entire band.
