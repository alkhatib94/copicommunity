# Custom Dome - Motion Capture/Custom Avatars

Template for a Player owned Custom Domes that can be customized

Cornucopias is built on the **Unreal Engine**, which is an extremely powerful games and media platform. Cornucopias intends to use as many of the advanced tools available as possible.

To bring a truly unique experience to your custom dome guests requires a bit more preparation and equipment.

We are experienced in providing live or recorded events that your guests will be able to enjoy and interact with using **motion capture technology** that tracks and records your actions in real time and sends them to your in-game avatar.

[Unreal Engine has been used in many Hollywood studio films and TV shows](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/uses/film-television?sessionInvalidated=true)

We can build custom avatars that look like **you in real life**, or create **alien or animal avatars**, depending on the look you require.
