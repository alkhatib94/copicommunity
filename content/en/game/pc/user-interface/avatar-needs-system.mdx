# Avatar Needs System

Avatar Needs System is a term that encapsulates a multitude of requirements the player has to fulfill in order to manage or optimize their avatar's physical abilities.

### Physical Abilities

- Endurance and running speed  
- Weapon aim, focus, and control  
- The ability to hold breath underwater  


### Nutrition & Hydration  

The player must fulfil nutritional requirements. This entails a resource consumption system where the avatar must eat food items and stay hydrated in order to maintain or enhance sustenance.  

Some food and drink items will be more nutritious than others, which in turn creates a hierarchy of value amongst food items. This in-game function will create demand for crops and livestock, effectively powering the farming industry.  



### Sleeping  

Sleeping is an essential requirement the player must fulfill. This in-game function will recharge the avatar's body and mind.  

Sleeping can be completed at:
- Beds in apartments or houses  
- Hotels  
- Campsites  

This function creates demand for buildings and rest points.  



### Weather & Environment  

Weather conditions will affect an avatar's physical abilities:  
- **Hot climates** → more water required  
- **Cold climates** → warm clothing required (e.g., winter coats)  

This creates demand for clothing items, fueling the in-game fashion industry.

    Traditional games incorporate a basic health and stamina system. In contrast, Cornucopias is aiming to create an ambitious metaverse, adding additional layers of immersion and player management.

### Increased Demand  

Avatars who engage in strenuous physical activity will find a greater need for these systems as their nutrition will be depleted faster.  



### Sources of Food & Drink  

- Growing crops (fruits/vegetables)  
- Purchasing food at market stalls or merchants  
- Buying from vending machines  
- Foraging in nature  
- Hunting, capturing, and cooking wild game  
- Rewards from in-game tasks and activities  
- Trading food items with other players

    It is possible for the avatar to faint if their energy is depleted.  
    In this case, the avatar will be transported to a Medical Facility to recover.
