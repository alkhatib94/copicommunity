# Avatar Creator

The interface to create your Avatar

<br/>   

Within Cornucopias, players experience the game through a **3D avatar**.  
Using a state-of-the-art creation system, players can customize their avatar’s appearance with a **slider interface**.  

This includes:
- Body type  
- Skin color  
- Facial features  
- Hair style & hair color  
- Eye color  

You will play with a **single avatar** that you can update whenever you please.



## Viewpoints

Cornucopias offers **two perspectives**:  
- **Third-person view** → the player sees the world from behind and above their avatar.  
- **First-person view** → the player sees directly through their avatar’s eyes, creating a unique and immersive experience -especially during races in [Calido Valley](../../calido-valley/resort/raceway).  



## Evolution of Avatars

Our avatar style has **evolved over the years** as we build, test, receive feedback, and update.  

- **20 April 2024** → “Facelift” build release.  
- **July 2025** → major update to the avatar system.  

The art style has shifted from the **early cartoon low-poly look** to more **detailed Nanite-based models**.  
We are not aiming for pure realism, but we are heading closer in that direction.  



## New Mechanics

The updated avatar system is more than just a visual upgrade.  
It introduces new **under-the-hood mechanics** to improve:  
- Avatar animation  
- Player interactions
