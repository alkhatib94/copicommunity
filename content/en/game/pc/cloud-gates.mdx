To explore the Themed Zones and the City, players need to fly through one of the cloud gates. The cloud gates provide safe and speedy passage into the deeper realms of the Cornucopias metaverse where the larger domes can be found.  

The cloud gates will have floating signs, pointing you in the right directions for your chosen destinations.
