# Seasons

Life evolves as the days go by ..

The Cornucopias year will be divided into Seasons, which define the passage of time and are used to add an extra layer of gameplay to the Metaverse.  

The seasons will reflect real life seasons such as Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.​  

The Districts compete with each other every season to determine which district in each zone is top of their District League.

  <strong>Note:</strong> Seasons will be key to the players strategy and will be a very important element to game progression and rewards.

With the changing of seasons, changes may occur to one or many of the themed zone maps.​  

Each season will also come with unique sets of NFTs that will only ever be available to mint during that season.​
