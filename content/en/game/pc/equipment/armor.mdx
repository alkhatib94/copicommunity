# Armor

Armor is a form of apparel a player can equip to their body. It is the most effective way of defending against in-coming physical damage in Cornucopias. Different armor sets will have varying levels of protection based upon the armor quality. Armor quality depends upon the resources used and skill of the Crafter.
