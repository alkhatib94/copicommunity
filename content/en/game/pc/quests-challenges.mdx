# Quest and Challenges 

Quests and challenges are tasks the player can perform in Cornucopias. Upon completion, players may receive rewards.  
Active quests are stored on a player's hologram interface.  

## Quests 

As the player ventures to the Themed Zones in Cornucopias, they will gather quests.  
They are obtained by speaking to NPCs or stumbling upon new locations.  
Quests provide engaging activities and rewarding experiences.  

## Daily Challenges 

Every district will have a **Town Hall**, which is a location to gather daily challenges, but it’s only accessible to village members.  

These challenges may include: 

<ul class="styled-list">
  <li><strong> Gathering specific resources</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Farming crops </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Playing mini-games </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Visiting points of interest </strong></li>
</ul>  


If the player completes all tasks within a single “game day”, they will unlock their **Play-and-Earn rewards**.
