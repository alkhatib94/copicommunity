# Game Launcher  

Interact with your NFTs like never before  

## The First Cardano & Base Blockchain Desktop NFT Wallet App  

The **Game Launcher** (previously known as the Desktop Launcher) is the <span className="text-orange-500">first Microsoft Windows Multi-Chain Cardano &amp; Base Chain blockchain application with advanced NFT support</span>.  
It helps users locate and start **Cornucopias-related computer programs and media**.  

Once installed it will be available as an icon on the userâ€™s desktop PC or laptop and will be the starting point for the adventure into the **Cornucopias Metaverse**.  

<div className="note-box success transparent">
  The Launcher aims to close the gap between traditional gamers and blockchain gamers by making the blockchain layer almost invisible.  
  It will also educate newcomers to the new world of Play-and-Earn gaming.

    <ul className="styled-list">
      <li>Compatible wallets will be announced as dApp connectors become integrated.</li>
      <li>There are two known desktop dApps we are working with that are currently under construction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

\* Future development update  

</br>

The entire **Cornucopias Game Architecture** interconnects with each other in some way via various APIs.  

<div className="note-box">
  <strong>Note:</strong> dApp - A decentralized application (dApp) is an application built on a decentralized network with blockchain connectivity and a frontend user interface.
</div>

</br>

## Other Wallets  

Other wallets will be available to connect via **dApps** such as *Metamask* in the future.  
Currently, only **Cardano and Base wallets** will be compatible with the current edition.  

## Security  

The Launcher will have **security as its number one priority**, and the code will be independently tested and audited before launch.  

## Connectivity  

The Launcher works in the background alongside the **Unreal Engine game** to provide services such as blockchain functionality, server connectivity, and other **API integrations** that are better suited to a desktop application than a games engine.  

The Launcher will be updated and will grow into an invaluable piece of critical **Cornucopias infrastructure**.
