# Gameplay - eSports Cornucopias Racing League

**eSports - a first for the Cardano Blockchain**

The **Cornucopias Racing League** is being developed alongside the main game and is based within the **Cornucopias Metaverse**.  

Hosted in the **Calido Valley Mega Dome**, the Racing Game introduces the first in-game **eSports experience** to Cornucopias.

It can be seen as a type of **Mini-Game** within Cornucopias with the first released version of the Racing League (the **Minimal Viable Product - MVP**) being based in the Mega Dome known as **Calido Valley**.  

In the future, the **Racing League** will also have tracks in other Themed Zones.

## Gameplay

To begin with you will get a **“Glimpse of Solace”** artwork as you enter and get to run around the **Mega Dome**.  
There will be a number of activities to do here, even before the racing game begins.
