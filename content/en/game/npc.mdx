# Non-Player Characters

A non-player character (NPC) is any character in a game that is not controlled by a player. This usually means a character controlled by the computer (instead of a player) that has a predetermined set of behaviors that potentially will impact gameplay.  

These characters can be thought of as the supporting cast of the journey while the player is the protagonist. Their relationship with the player can be that of allies, enemies or simply indifferent.  

They are useful to interact with, as some may offer quests, highlight places of interest, or engage with for trading.  

Cornucopias will have many non-player characters. Some will be more important to the overall story than others.
