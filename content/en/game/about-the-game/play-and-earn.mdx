# Play-and-Earn

The **Play-and-Earn** mantra is central to the Cornucopias vision:  
To bring power and new economics to the player.  

By playing Cornucopias and its various in-game experiences the player will earn in-game virtual currency.  



## Challenges & Rewards

Over **Seasons**, players will be presented with a list of challenges to complete, with varying levels of difficulty.  
These challenges may include:  
- Resource collection  
- Time trials  
- Fishing  
- Racing  
- Map exploration  
- And many more!  

Upon successful completion of the challenges, players are entered into the **Play-and-Earn reward pot**.  
This is a **daily quantity of in-game currency** which is distributed among all successful players.  

For more details, see the [Tokenomics section](/en/blockchain/tokenomics).



## Changing the Game

Traditionally, development companies make profits while gamers only spend money on in-game assets that are trapped inside the game.  

In **Cornucopias**, players are rewarded with **cryptocurrency** for contributing to a free-to-play game.  
**NFTs and in-game assets are owned** by players and can be sold or traded with others.
