# Artwork
<br /><br />
We genuinely care about every asset in our game.  
We know how to build fast, but we choose the slow route, because we want to deliver a high-quality experience that will be engaging and future proof.
<br /><br />
We build every single asset in our game, from the grass to the clouds.  
This is not cheap and not easy. **Cornucopias is Built Different.**
