# Learn-and-Earn

Cornucopias is teaming up with some of the **best educational centers in the world** to build **learning into the metaverse**.  
One of our early partners is the **European Business University (EBU)**.



## Education in the Metaverse

Players become **students** and will be able to enjoy learning via our **educational centers**.  

Through these centers, players can access knowledge while being part of the game world.



## Rewards through Mini-Games

Learning is gamified through **educational mini-games**, where players:  
- Participate in learning challenges  
- Gain knowledge  
- Earn in-game rewards  

These mini-games generate **in-game currency** for players.



## From Learning to Earning

The in-game currency earned through **Learn-and-Earn** can be **transferred into cryptocurrency**,  
providing real-world value for playersâ€™ learning efforts.
