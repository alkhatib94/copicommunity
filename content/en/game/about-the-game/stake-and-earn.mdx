# Stake-and-Earn

**Staking** is a way of earning rewards for holding a specific amount of **$COPI tokens** in staking pools for a predetermined period of time.  
This allows users to gain a return on assets, which would otherwise be unproductive by just staying in wallets.  



## Types of Staking

There are currently two types of staking available:



### Token Staking

Players can earn rewards for staking **$COPI**.  
Using **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**, players can purchase tokens, then lock them in a staking pool for a set amount of days.  

In return, players will have access to various rewards depending on how much they stake and for how long.  

**Rewards include:**
- $COPI rewarded for yield farming and traditional staking  
- **NFT rewards** (kept in wallets, traded, or sold for real-world value)  
- **Access to exclusive in-game areas**  



### NFT Staking - Properties

Players can earn rewards for staking **specific NFTs** and locking them to another NFT.

#### Districts

In each **Themed Zone**, there are **Districts** that contain land plots owned by players.  
Districts are given daily rewards based on the performance of their residents.  
Rewards are split into two pots (see Tokenomics):  

- **District land property owners reward pot**  
- **District tenant rewards pot**  



#### Land Property Owners

Land property owners receive a **percentage of the district’s rewards** based on the number of tenants they have.  
To become a property owner, you need to purchase a **land property NFT**.

**Example:**  
If a district has 80 residents and one property contains 10 residents, that property owner receives **12.5%** of the reward pot.  

**Formula:**  Individual Land Property Owner Rewards = Total District Residents divided by Individual Property Tenants.


#### Property Levels

A property can be **upgraded** to increase the number of tenants.  
This increases the potential population of a district.  



#### Becoming a Tenant

To become a resident of a district:  
1. Find a property within a district that has room to rent.  
2. Use the property web portal on the Cornucopias website.  
3. Stake your **Seasonal Tenant Key NFT** to that property.  



#### Property Tenants

Property tenants also receive a **percentage of the rewards**.  
To become a tenant, you need a valid **Seasonal Tenant Key NFT**.  

**Example:**  
If a district has 80 tenants, each receives **1.25%** of the tenant reward pot.  

**Formula:**  Individual Tenant Rewards = 100% divided by Total District Tenants.



### NFT Staking

NFT Staking is another way to earn **$COPI** and in-game rewards by staking your NFTs.  

- Similar to **Cardano ADA Staking**, NFTs do **not** need to leave your wallet (beware of scammers).  
- The **rarity** of an NFT may affect rewards.  

**Examples of stakeable NFTs:**
- Themed Zone Land  
- Flying Vehicles  
- Custom Dome Land
