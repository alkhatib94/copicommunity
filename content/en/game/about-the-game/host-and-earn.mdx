# Host-and-Earn

**Empowering players and decentralizing parts of the gaming ecosystem.**

Players have the opportunity to **Host-and-Earn** in Cornucopias.  
Users can host their own games and help support critical infrastructure.



## Hosting Nodes

Players purchase a **license** to run a Cornucopias **Node**.  
There are a number of **Host-and-Earn Nodes** available for players to own and run themselves.  

More information can be found in the [COPI Node section](/en/nodes/rewards).  

Players who become public node operators may be rewarded with **$COPI**.  


## Decentralized Gaming

This is essential to the **decentralized element** of Cornucopias.  
It gives power and connectivity directly to the users.  

Hosting occurs on **playersâ€™ PCs** and is an **add-on feature** available to support both the **game Launcher** and the **main game**.
