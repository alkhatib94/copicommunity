# In-game Rewards

## Dynamic Rewards Structure

The following types of rewards are planned and will be available when they are launched and ready.  
Full detail on the following rewards will be provided soon.  

$COPI In-game rewards are reserved for:
- Active themed zone land NFT owners
- Top performing district members (tenants)
- Top performing leaderboard entrants
- Other quests and gameplay activities that earn you Rewards Points (RP)

In-game currency, in-game items, XP and NFTs -can be earned by all players.  

As described in the Reward Distribution section, player rewards will be calculated based on their individual contribution over a defined time period out of the total contribution earned by eligible players. Contribution will be defined as the Reward Points (RP) earned by a player during various gameplay activities.  

RP can be earned through all facets of the game, including:
- Land Ownership and Progression
- Racing Events
- Quests
- Exploration
- Mining
- Fishing
- Farming
- Gathering
- Crafting
- Building
- Combat

RP is not to be confused with XP. RP is earned for predefined skill-based accomplishments in the game and is only tied to calculating your share of the gameplay rewards allocation.  
XP, however, is tied to progression within the game that can lead to earning RP.

<div className="note-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> To align player rewards with strategic objectives and manage potential risks, we've introduced a mechanism that functions as a Key Risk Indicator (KRI). This involves a dynamic daily rewards cap, activated based on daily active users (DAU) metrics. This strategy is designed to preemptively identify and mitigate risks associated with player engagement and the game economy. 
<br />
Specifically, if the DAU is notably low on any given day, it triggers an adjustment in the rewards distribution to an average basis. 
<br />
This proactive measure does not necessarily result in reduced rewards for players but ensures that the rewards earned are genuinely reflective of skilled contributions. It aims to discourage passive or automated participation, thereby enhancing the overall game experience by rewarding meaningful and engaged play..

## Building
The platform enables participants to mint or discover various NFTs while immersing themselves in the game. Additionally, users can trade or sell these NFTs on the marketplace.

Cornucopias is collaborating with some of the world's top educational institutions to integrate learning into the platform.  

Institutions must:  
- Pay a fee in $COPI.  
- Stake $COPI for 1 month without the option to unstake.  

## Hosting
Cornucopias will empower users to participate in the distributed node network by running their own nodes.  

Benefits include:
- Access to **Node Owner Discord Group**  
- Early testing access on desktop, mobile, and web  
- Exclusive Node Owner NFTs (outfits, emotes, backpacks)

<div className="code-box">
<strong>Simplified Formula</strong><br />
Daily Rewards per Node = Daily Allocation from the Reward Pool / Number of Nodes on the Platform
</div>

<div className="quote-box">
<strong>Example for day 1:</strong><br /><br />
Estimated Node Rewards Allocation for Season: <strong>6,500,000 $COPI</strong><br />
Number of nodes active: <strong>12,000</strong> (estimated year 1)<br />
Assumed daily reward per node: <strong>71,428 / 12,000 = 5.95 $COPI</strong><br /><br />
This reward varies depending on depletion/replenishment of the pool and fluctuation in active nodes.<br />
<strong>Up to 10% of all node fees collected</strong> will be earmarked for buyback and LP funds.
