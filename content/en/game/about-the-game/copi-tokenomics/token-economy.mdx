# Token Economy

## Token Utility and use-cases

$COPI is the core utility token of the Cornucopias ecosystem. The token will be structured with a max supply.  
The COPI Token facilitates the purchase of goods and services on the platform, grants access to governance through single-token staking, unlocks in-game rewards, and provides incentives for liquidity providers, node operators, and token stakers.  

Furthermore, the Cornucopias platform, where users can trade NFTs (including those created by the game), accepts $COPI as the exclusive currency for game assets and game related items. Payments can be made directly by the user or through a third-party app like MoonPay to accommodate fiat users.  

One of the many features offered by $COPI is its staking mechanism, enabling token stakeholders to participate in governance based on their commitment (token allocation). But that's not all; staking $COPI introduces stakeholders to various utilities and rewards. Let's dive into it.


## $COPI Utility

$COPI is the utility token that powers the gaming ecosystem of Cornucopias.  
Listed below are some of the utilities.  
*Note: As our game and ecosystem evolve, so will our token utility.*

### Official Marketplace Currency: $COPI
- $COPI is the primary currency used within the game marketplace for acquiring assets and in-game items, including:
  - Outfits  
  - Tools  
  - Weapons  
  - Vehicles  
  - Properties  
  - Tournament passes  
  - Other exclusive items  

- Sales for items such as node licenses or advertisement space may be available for purchase in currencies other than $COPI.  
- While $COPI remains the foundation of our marketplace, select partner tokens (e.g., $SUPER) may be accepted for specific items or special promotions.  



### Governance
- Community feedback proposals on rewards, gameplay, features, development, and events.  
- Voting is **exclusively for $COPI stakers (directly or via LP tokens)**.  
- Each token represents **one vote**.  



### Rewards
- Achievement-based in-game rewards.  
- Rewards for node operators.  
- Staking rewards.  



### Advertising
Advertise in the **Cornucopias Game Ad Network**.  
A **B2B subscription service** that allows businesses, guilds, and brands to purchase exposure.  
Preferential discounts are applied for payments made in $COPI.  



## $COPI Staking

Staking allows holders to yield $COPI. Incentives are governed by governance proposals, with APY paid from the reward pool.

Three methods of staking:

1. **Stake for NFTs** - lock $COPI to earn exclusive NFTs (Soulbound Tokens - SBTs).  
2. **Stake for $COPI** - earn additional $COPI depending on amount staked.  
3. **Stake for Discounts** - earn discounts in Marketplace purchases.

## Buy Back and Liquidity Provision (BB & LP)

The **Buyback and LP strategy** merges the key advantages of buyback/burn with liquidity strengthening.  
Instead of burning tokens outright, a portion is allocated to liquidity pools.  

**Example flow:**
1. User buys a Cornucopias node license for **$300**.  
2. 10% ($30) is allocated to **BB & LP**, while $270 funds operations.  
3. $15 is used to buy $COPI at market price.  
4. $15 is converted to USDC.  
5. Both are added to the **$COPI/USDC liquidity pool**.

<strong>Note:</strong> Up to 10% of node fees will be allocated to BB & LP funds.

## Governance

Cornucopias aims to gradually become more decentralized.  
Currently, token stakers can vote on governance matters.

- **Voting eligibility:**  
  - Staked $COPI  
  - Staked LP tokens  
  - (Excludes: unclaimed rewards, vesting tokens, non-staked tokens)

- **Voting process:**  
  - Proposals created on Snapshot â†’ [https://snapshot.org/#/](https://snapshot.org/#/)  
  - Can be **Yes/No** or **Multiple choice**.  
  - Each vote is **non-binding**, but helps guide project direction.
