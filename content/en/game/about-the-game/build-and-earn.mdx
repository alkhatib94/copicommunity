# Build-and-Earn

Resources exist throughout the **Cornucopias metaverse**, and are an essential part of the in-game economy.  

Provided players have the tools required, they are able to find and gather resources like **wood, metal, crops, and fabrics** in order to craft valuable items such as:  
- Weapons  
- Tools  
- Clothing  
- Furniture  
- Functional buildings  


## Crops & Food Economy

Resources in the **crops and food** categories have two core functionalities:  
1. **Player sustenance**  
2. **Vehicle fuel**  

This entails a resource consumption system that revolves around maintaining and exhausting the charactersâ€™ needs to perform actions within the game.  

- Players must eat meals (crafted by combining multiple crops) to maintain performance.  
- Crops can also be converted into **biofuel**, which powers cars and equipment throughout the world.  



## Building on Land

Players have the ability to use their land to construct buildings with different **utility features**, including but not limited to:  

- **Residential houses**: for players to live in or rent  
- **Farms**: enabling players to grow and harvest crops  
- **Merchants**: for peer-to-peer commerce  
- **Workshops**: for processing resources and crafting items  

Using land to build any of the above has the potential to generate **in-game currency**.  

It will be up to the **land owner** to analyze the economy of the environment so they can strategically plan their endeavors.  



## The Resource Economy

The **resource economy** is the key aspect around which the Build-and-Earn element of Cornucopias revolves.  

Valuable materials and crafted items can then be **sold in exchange for in-game currency**.
