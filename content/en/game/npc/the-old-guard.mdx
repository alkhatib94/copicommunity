# NPC - The Old Guard (OG)

**Discord Active Role and Non Player Character (NPC)**


## OG Definitions

The Old Guard has a number of definitions within Cornucopias, but they all share the same values.  

<div className="note-box">
  <strong>OG Values:</strong> helpful community member, reliable and gives consistent advice and support.
</div>


## The Old Guard - Discord Role

Like most projects, the early arrival of supporters are known as the OGs.  
The early OGs were defined as joining the Cornucopias Discord before **October 13, 2021**. They were the original members that had been with Cornucopias since the beginning.  

However, it was clear internally, the role had to evolve, and so slowly "bots" were removed and we are adding more community members regularly.  
The new OG members are chosen from the existing non-OG community members that are classed as being extraordinarily helpful to newcomers and have consistent activity.  

Although the OG role is given within the Cornucopias Discord, it is also given as recognition for contributions **outside of Discord** such as:  

<ul class="styled-list">
  <li><strong>YouTube channel with regular content about Cornucopias</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Telegram channel with regular content about Cornucopias</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Instagram channel with regular content about Cornucopias</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Twitter channel with regular content about Cornucopias</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Other channels with regular content about Cornucopias</strong></li>
</ul>  

Producing regular content that has a positive impact towards the Cornucopias project is encouraged.  
**Positive does not mean "being biased"**  fair, balanced feedback is welcomed.
