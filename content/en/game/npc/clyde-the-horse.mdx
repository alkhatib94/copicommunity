# NPC - Clyde the Horse

**Non Player Character (NPC)**

Little is known so far of the origins of <span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:600;">Clyde the horse</span>, except that he is part of a larger string of horses seen galloping freely through the Wild West - Themed Zone.  

Owned by Abigale, Clyde the horse will hopefully become a future favorite as mounts are introduced to Cornucopias.
