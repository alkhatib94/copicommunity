# NPC - Farmer Joe

**Non Player Character (NPC)**

<span style="color:#fbbf24; font-weight:600;">Farmer Joe</span> was the first ever character revealed to the world on October 11th 2021 and will forever be cherished.  
He was the first in-house built character the Cornucopias team created and introduced the art style we would build upon for the 1st version of Cornucopias.

Alongside Farmer Joe, Cornucopias showcased early development on the first Themed Zone, working titled: **Life on the Farm**.  
During this startup period the team had less than 10 members and as usual we were all working flat out to build the best game we could.  

Before Farmer Joe, we had built a number of mini-game prototypes using off-the-shelf characters from the Unreal Engine marketplace.  
This proved to be a great strategy for our bootstrapped, self-funded project (at the time) as it enabled us to get the concept of our metaverse across to early investors.
