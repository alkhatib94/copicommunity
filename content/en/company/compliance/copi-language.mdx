# COPIWiki - Language and Dictionaries   

The Cornucopias founders are in the **UK** and **USA**.  
However, for consistency the website and **COPIWiki** have been written using **American English** spelling as it is more universal across the internet.  

</br>

Therefore you will see words such as <span className="wiki-color-purple">Color</span>,<span className="wiki-color-orange">Armor</span> ,<span className="wiki-color-green">Decentralization</span>  
that are American English that would appear as spelling mistakes in a British English dictionary that would be expecting the spellings  <span className="wiki-color-purple">Colour</span> ,<span className="wiki-color-orange">Armour</span>,<span className="wiki-color-green">Decentralisation</span> .
