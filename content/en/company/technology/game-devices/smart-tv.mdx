# Smart TV  

Connecting to the **Cornucopias Metaverse** via your internet-connected Television.  

A **Smart TV** is a traditional television set that has the ability to connect to the internet and allows for connected services such as streaming music and videos, browsing the internet, and viewing photos.  

There are already a lot of Smart TV apps from the likes of **Samsung, LG, Sony, Hisense, and TCL** that allow you to play games via your set-top box.  

Some TV manufacturers already have versions of their operating systems running on Smart TVs, and Google Play and Apple App Store have a limited number of games available to install and play.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Smart TVs of the future have the potential to revolutionize home gaming. Game streaming services may eventually replace the need for a home console or PC.

We believe Smart TV apps will have a key part to play in the future of gaming, which is why we already have them on our **Roadmap**.

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> Although we suspect high-end gaming on PCs and consoles will be around for at least another decade, Smart TVs will likely have similar-if not the same-games as mobile devices in the next few years.

This section will be expanded over time as we introduce **Smart TV functionality** into Cornucopias.
