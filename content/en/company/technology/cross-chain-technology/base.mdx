# BASE Chain  

Base Chain is an **Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain** network developed by **Coinbase**.  
It is designed to improve scalability, performance, and interoperability while reducing transaction costs and settlement time on the Ethereum network.  
As a decentralized platform, Base supports a wide range of **dApps** and **smart contracts**.

## Transaction Processing  

Base's off-chain processing model works to significantly reduce costs and the load on Ethereum's mainnet.  
This is achieved through **rollups**, where multiple transactions are bundled together into a single batch.  
This batch is then submitted to the **Ethereum L1** for validation, reducing the number of on-chain interactions while maintaining the security and immutability provided by Ethereum.
