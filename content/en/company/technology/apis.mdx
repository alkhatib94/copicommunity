# APIs  

**API - Application Programming Interface**  

The APIs are built on **Microsoft .Net Framework** and allow our applications to talk to each other.  

The APIs provide a standard way for our developers to communicate with the backend database, to send and receive player information, and to keep track of player scores and district levels, etc.
