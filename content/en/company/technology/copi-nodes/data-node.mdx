# COPI Data Node  

The **Launcher** has a number of add-on features that enable it to host a secure, encrypted, decentralized version of the **Cornucopias database** and also player and game files.  

When the **COPI Data Node license** is activated, a decentralized node is run in the background on the playerâ€™s desktop PC.  
This node maintains the files and database updates - it also maintains connections to other replicated databases and services.

## COPI Data Node Rewards  

A player needs to **purchase an NFT license** to host a COPI Data Node, and it is their responsibility to ensure the node software stays up-to-date (we will inform you of any updates) and that it remains available for use for a **minimum number of agreed hours per day** and with a **minimum performance rating**.  

In return for hosting, players will be rewarded with [$COPI tokens](/blockchain/token-copi) and/or other rewards.  
Rewards will be based on the **up-time** and the **performance** of the COPI Data Node.
