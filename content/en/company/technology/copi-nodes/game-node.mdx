# COPI Game Node  

When a player plays the **PC version of Cornucopias**, they always need to join the Cornucopias network - this is done via an **Unreal Engine Server Instance**.  

</br>

During gameplay, the player may join and disconnect from many COPI Game Nodes.  
For example, when joining a mini-game, the player will connect to the COPI Game Node that the mini-game is being played on before rejoining the main COPI Game Node they were on before.  

</br>

The coordination of the node servers is done using the [COPI Data Node](/company/technology/copi-nodes/data-node).  

</br>

Cornucopias uses **COPI Data Nodes** and **COPI Game Nodes** for many functions.  


</br>


## COPI Game Node Rewards  

**COPI Game Nodes require an NFT license to run.**  
This establishes the player as a COPI Game Node operator and allows their PC to participate in Cornucopias decentralization.  

</br>

In return for hosting a COPI Game Node, players will be rewarded with [$COPI tokens](/blockchain/token-copi) and/or other rewards. Rewards will be based on the **up-time** and the **performance** of the COPI Game Node.
