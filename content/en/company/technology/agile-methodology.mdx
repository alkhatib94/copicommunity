# Agile Methodology  

## Project Development  

The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating. These short term cycles are known as **sprints**.  

An example of the Cornucopias Development Team using this agile methodology is **Calido Valley**, which will be built as a scaled-down version of the Themed Zones. Calido Valley will introduce players to all game features and game mechanics. It is also an opportunity for the development team to test assets and functionality before moving them into the Themed Zones.  

Thus, Cornucopias will create a functional version of the game sooner and a means to expand with new features as functionality becomes available.

  <b>Governance Impact:</b> This methodology also supports the establishment of community governance, where the public will be able to contribute and vote on features to be added.

The development of the blockchain **Play-and-Earn** will be built initially using a **test environment**.
