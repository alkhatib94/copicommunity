# Governance  

Cornucopias government, or choice of rule, will be decided by the **NFT Land**, **NFT Property**, and **Cornucopias $COPI Token** owners.  

Decisions by majority voting and settings will take place within the **Town Hall** located in one or many of the zones or cities. The **Cornucopias Council** will evolve to a decentralized government involved in all ideas, concerns, and discussions with the team.  

The council will have a voice on every part of the game, from fees to new developments.

## On-chain Governance  

In order to promote decentralized community governance for the network, the **$COPI token** will allow holders to propose and vote on on-chain governance proposals to determine future features and/or parameters of Cornucopias.  

<div className="note-box transparent">
The right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of Cornucopias.  
It does not entitle token holders to:
<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>Vote on the operation and management of the Company or its affiliates</li>
  <li>Vote on the board of directors or development direction of the entities</li>
  <li>Constitute any equity interest or collective investment scheme</li>
  <li>Form any type of joint venture or partnership</li>
</ul>
</div>

</br>

## In-game Governance  

Voting on real-world game mechanics will happen occasionally in the **Town Hall**, where all **NFT Character Owners** will be eligible to vote at **one vote per NFT owner**.  

</br>

## Land Ownership & Participation  

An important part of the ecosystem is to make **digital land ownership** available to as many players as possible.  

- **Land ownership is not a necessity** to play the game.  
- However, there are **benefits** to owning land:  
  - Access to exclusive privileges  
  - Preferential in-game terms  
  - Ability to rent land to other users  

Other ways of offering land and NFTs to players include:  

<ul className="styled-list">
  <li>Via our partners network</li>
  <li>In-game promotions</li>
  <li>Player rewards</li>
</ul>
