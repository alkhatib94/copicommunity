ChainPort create bridges between blockchains, and aim to turn fragmented crypto spaces into a unified universe.  

</br>  

ChainPort's technology leverages smart contracts to port tokens between blockchains formerly locked inside a monochain environment that prevents interchain exchanges.  

</br>  

The Cornucopias **$COPI** token was first launched on the Binance Smart Chain on 10th December 2021 and from almost day 1 Cornucopias have been working with ChainPort working on a bridge to allow the transfer of the $COPI Token from Binance to Cardano and vice versa. The ultimate goal is to have the $COPI token on multiple Layer 1 chains for maximum Utility for the Cornucopias Metaverse.  

</br>  

<span className="text-orange-500 font-semibold">On 31st October 2022 the Binance to Cardano bridge was finally opened after 9 months of development.
There were some delays due to the Cardano Vasil Hard Fork and external audits and checks from various parties including IOHK but overall it was a huge success for Cornucopias and the Cardano & Binance blockchains.

</br>  

Astonishingly, over **45 million $COPI tokens** were bridged from the Binance Smart Chain to Cardano within the first 24 hours!
